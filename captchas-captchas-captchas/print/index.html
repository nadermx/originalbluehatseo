You guessed it. Captchas! In fact I feel like dedicating a whole week, maybe more depending on if any downtime occurs. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  to talking about nothing but captcha breaking. We&#8217;ll break every captcha in the book and even by the end of this post the captchas that haven&#8217;t been created yet. Furthermore, for this week only I am accepting any and all captcha related guest posts. So if you got a captcha solved or want to discuss techniques to breaking them feel free to write up a guest post and email it to ELI at BLUEHATSEO.COM in html form. You can stay anonymous and not only will I put it up but I&#8217;m also willing to put up any ad you&#8217;d like. Pick any text or banner ad you&#8217;d like to put up with your post and I&#8217;ll include it. With as many readers as this place has I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll get clicked. Also be sure to include your paypal address. If I really like your guest post I may even send you a $100 as a thank you. Also, all you bloggers are welcome to repost any of the captcha related posts on this blog. I now declare any captcha related posts on this blog public domain and republishable under full rights. For some odd reason I feel like blowing the captcha breaking industry the fuck up. Like my favorite saying goes, if you&#8217;re going to wreck a room you might as well WRECK it. Lets begin by visiting one of my first captcha related posts; the [1] <a href="/creating-an-army-of-free-captcha-typers/" rel="external"><strong>Army Of Captcha Typers</strong></a>.</p> <p>The Army of Captcha Typers is a great technique because it doesn&#8217;t require loads of programming and is 100% adaptable to any captcha. I suggest you go back and reread it, but in interest of keeping this short here&#8217;s a quick summary.</p> <blockquote><p> You use a service, I used a proxy site as an example, to get the users to type in the captchas for you. It records what the user typed in as the solution to the captcha and you use that to solve it. The more pageviews the service provides per user the more effective it is to breaking captchas. Why pay Indians or tediously code it yourself?</p></blockquote> <p>Normally I like to leave most of the code and creative portion out of the written technique in interest of not ruining the technique and to help the methods be more effective through use of spins and unique code. I don&#8217;t write this blog to ruin techniques, and those people who claim I do are just insecure and like to claim they already know everything. As common sense as most of the stuff I post is, I haven&#8217;t met a person yet who hasn&#8217;t in some way learned something from this blog. That truth brags a lot louder than most SEO blogs I&#8217;ve seen. But! If we&#8217;re going to wreck something lets wreck it. In that spirit I see no reason why every newbie on the planet shouldn&#8217;t be able to easily throw up their own web proxy site that solves captchas for them so here&#8217;s the script to do it.</p> <p>[2] <a href="/wp-content/uploads/captchasolverproxy.zip" rel="external"><strong>Captcha Solving Web Proxy</strong></a></p> <p>This a modified version of CGIPROXY that I mentioned in the post. Basically you install it following the included instructions (README file). Then you setup your web proxy site. Target a niche such as kids behind a school proxy or something similar. There is an extra file included called captcha.cgi. Upload it to the cgi-bin in the same folder as the nph-proxy.cgi and give it 755 chmod permissions. Make a folder one directory below your cgi-bin called captchas. Give it read/write permissions (777 should work all else fails). Then anytime you got a captcha to solve upload it to that directory with a unique filename. This can be done automatically with whatever script you&#8217;re using to spam a captcha protected site. On the very next pageview the webproxy will require the person to type in the captcha and disguise it as a human check to prevent abuse. Any captcha works. Once it gets their response it&#8217;ll delete the captcha from the folder and write out the solution along with the filename to a new file called solved.txt. Format: characters|image.jpg\n . Remember to make some kind of reminder or code for the filename so you know which image is which when you go to use the solutions. Get enough users to your webproxy (which is very easy) and you can solve any captcha in moments.</p> <p><strong>Enjoy!</strong></p> </div> 						<hr class="Divider" align="center" /> 									<p id="CommentTitle">Comments Disabled To "Captchas Captchas Captchas"</p>				 						 		<p class="CommentDate"><b>#1 Comment</b> By <u>YoungMaster</u> On March 17, 2008 @ 11:16 pm</p> 		<div class="CommentContent"><p>&#8220;For some odd reason I feel like blowing the captcha breaking industry the fuck up.&#8221; ROTFL!

As a developer I think it would be much easier to spend some time to just break the captchas. You don&#8217;t need a fancy algorithm. Neural networks is just fine and gives decent results even with a lot of garbage data around. After you have made your first captcha breaker you can reuse code and make a new one a any time. If you don&#8217;t know how to but have a noble purpose (aka educational purpose <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> ) pay somebody in India or Eastern Europe to do it.
