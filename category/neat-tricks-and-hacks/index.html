Thanks for sharing your knowledge. One thing confuses me about this particular tactic. Where are you getting the content from? You mentioned Audioscrobbler and Youtube API but I am not focusing on a music niche. The “widely available car db” sounds more like something I could use. Can you say where you would get something like this from? Also is there any reason why I should use customized pages instead of a CMS like Wordpress to generate these kinds of sites? </p></blockquote> <p>Upon a glancing read this question seems to focus too much on the exact example used in the post. Yet if you really read the multipart question thoroughly and get to its core it&#8217;s a FANTASTIC question that really needs an answer in more depth than what I would put in a comment response. The mininet building post isn&#8217;t about how to use APIs and RSS feeds to get content. Nor is it about creating a custom CMS or  doing multiple installs of the same site structure (I covered that in depth in my <a href="/seo-empire-part-1/">SEO Empire</a> post and called them ANT Scripts). The real down to brass tax gem behind the technique is understanding how to do <strong>Addon Domain Spam</strong> via environmental variables such as HTTP_HOST to create a lot of sites from a single install of ANYTHING. I&#8217;m absolutely a firm believer that addon domain spam is the future of webspam. Subdomains had their day and now its time for figuring out creative ways to create a ton of unique sites from a single platform. This doesn&#8217;t always have to be done through addon domains and as mentioned in the comments can be done through other ways such as editing the httpd.config. For now though I wanted to focus on the basics such as using addon domains and if you&#8217;d like to go cheap about it subdomains, and let the SEO ingenuity naturally evolve from there.</p> <p>To answer your question yes you can use databases to help with the content for these sites. Check out my <a href="/madlib-sites/">Madlib Sites</a> post for some great ideas on how to accomplish that and use databases. As for the second part YES you can use other CMS&#8217; such as Wordpress!</p> <p><strong>How To Use Wordpress To Do Addon Domain Spam</strong><br /> I got several emails from people asking how to create a wordpress plugin to accomplish this technique as well as a comment from the longtime reader PhatJ. I realize at first thought this sounds like a complicated process to be able to convert wordpress over to being able to read multiple addon domains and treat them as multiple installs and probably require some sort of plugin being created, but as with most things the simple solution is often the best.</p> <p>The easiest and most effective way to convert any CMS to be used for addon domains that I&#8217;ve found is to simply edit the config files. No joke, that&#8217;s seriously usually all it ever takes. In my wordpress wp-config.php file I grabbed the line that declared the database:</p> <p><strong>define(&#8217;DB_NAME&#8217;, &#8216;database1&#8242;);</strong></p> <p>I replaced it with a simple IF ELSE statement to check for the domain and define the appropriate database:</p> <p><strong><code>if ( $_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] == 'domain1.com' ) {<br /> 	define('DB_NAME', 'database1');<br /> }<br /> elseif($_SERVER["HTTP_HOST"] == 'domain2.com'){<br /> 	define('DB_NAME', 'database2');<br /> }else {<br /> 	define('DB_NAME', 'database1');<br /> }</code><br /> </strong></p> <p>Then I just pull each database in the browser or mass wordpress installer script and setup each blog as if it was separate.</p> <p>To show you it in action I put up a single Wordpress install on a subdomain on Bluehat. I then added a second database and put that code into the wp-config.php. Looking at each you&#8217;d have no idea they were a single wordpress install.

Thanks. I have a question. I’ve read through and I find the link building stuff (black hole SEO) a bit too complex, could you suggest any other effective link building techniques? I’ve heard great stuff about TNX.net.</p> <p>Thanks! </p></blockquote> <p>I haven&#8217;t heard of TNX, but here&#8217;s a really simple one most haven&#8217;t thought of. Much like ugly girls tend to have better personalities pretty and clean sites tend to be harder to link build, or at least take more effort initially. So a little technique I&#8217;ve been using a lot lately is to build sites that gather links really easy. A quick easy way to do this is to build a site that distributes something people want to either put on their websites or social site profiles (ie. myspace, facebook, youtube and such). I&#8217;ll give you the most basic of examples. In a really old post on this blog I put up this picture:<br /> <img src="/images/middle_finger_flame.jpg" alt="" /><br /> Since then everyone and their dog has been hotlinking to it, especially since it&#8217;ll often times show up in Google images for the term Middle Finger. Not that I care but it illustrates the stupid shit people spread and its effectiveness can be used for links as minuscule as it is. So lets say all I had in my arsenal was this stupid picture of a flaming middle finger. I post it up on some site get it in google images and such just like i did. Then under it I put a textbox that says something like Put this on your ____ copy past etc etc.  The code has a link to a random domain of mine, the domain doesn&#8217;t even have to be active, or it can be a money site. Who really cares? After awhile the flaming finger image gathers enough links to that domain that i just 301 redirect the domain over (doesn&#8217;t even have to be an entire domain as I&#8217;ll mention below). All the links goes to my new pretty site.</p> <p>This is a really weak example I realize, but it can be done with just about any media (video, image, flash, etc.) you&#8217;d like. It can be done with any type of site you&#8217;d like. As long as its the type that tends to be able to gather links faster than your other type of site. If I got big pretty sites coming out on a future date i can build several of these site and by the time the main site goes live I can have plenty of link volume to rank properly. The only reason why this extra work is necessary is because viral link building tends to be exponential. In other words you got to have links to get rankings and got to have rankings to have links. More links means more links. So it creates a nice little shove on a boat too big to leave the dock on its own. Best of all its really easy and rarely costs anything at all to do.</p> <p>If you&#8217;re wondering why this all kind of sounds familiar or like you should already know it, its because its a creative spin on two of the more popular techniques on this blog, <a href="/blue-hat-technique-16-link-laundering-sites/">Link Laundering Sites</a>, and <a href="/seo-empire-part-1/">Cycle Sites</a>. On a side note I&#8217;ve found that this also works on subdirectories. So you can create a site that distributes media or allows people to upload their own and it has em all on a separate subdirectory or page, the links can even go to the same page the item is on. Once each subdirectory or subpage gets enough links to it, cycle it out and let the links go to a site that needs em. You can also put the media up on another subdirectory to be used again in gathering more links. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  The best advice I can give you on this is to look for types of sites that gain links quickly right out of the gate. They may not make a lot of money, they may be high bandwidth, it doesn&#8217;t matter if they&#8217;re all temporary. You can still steal the idea to do some easy link building on the harder sites.</p> <p>More answers coming soon </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130511040936/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130511040936/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130511040936/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/quick-answers-1-link-building/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/quick-answers-1-link-building/"     dc:title="Quick Answers #1 - Easy Link Building"     trackback:ping="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/quick-answers-1-link-building/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/quick-answers-1-link-building/#comments" title="Comment on Quick Answers #1 - Easy Link Building">438 Comments &#187;</a></div>									</div> 							 				<div class="post"> 					<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/neat-tricks-and-hacks/" title="View all posts in Neat Tricks and Hacks" rel="category tag">Neat Tricks and Hacks</a></em>15 Jul 2007 09:47 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/link-injection-research/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Link Injection Research"><b>Link Injection Research</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Hi guys!<br /> Sorry I haven&#8217;t had a chance to post lately.

Searching directly for the <a href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;safe=off&amp;q=allinurl%3Achanges.txt">filenames</a>.</ol> <p>Check the changes and version logs and look for vulnerability fixes that happened recently.

I just put up a new Wordpress plugin that I&#8217;ve been wanting for awhile now.  It&#8217;s called Recommend It.</p> <p><strong>Recommend It - </strong>Allows your blog&#8217;s veteran readers to recommend posts to first time visitors through a simple voting system.</p> <p>You&#8217;ll notice that at the bottom of every post is now a button that allows you to recommend that post to first time readers. So now first time visitors here will be greeted with the posts that got the most recommendations from the veteran readers.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve been wanting a plugin like this really bad. I think it&#8217;s a great way to point your new readers to the real meat of your blog. I first got the idea for this when I saw several blogs that recently got links from bigger blogs and so they made special posts to welcome the readers. They all recommended a few of what they felt were their best posts for the new readers to check out. My reasoning was that they might be worried that the new flood of visitors would leave after not being able to find the good posts, or get the wrong impression about their blog from the most recent post. I started thinking about how much I could use something like that. Sometimes my most recent post isn&#8217;t always the best representation of the rest of my blog or the best for new readers to get introduced into the community with. It&#8217;s often best to leave it to the people who know your writings the best, your readers, to point your new visitors in the right direction. I personally would like to see this at the top of every blog I first visit.</p> <p>So I asked a buddy of mine, <removed>, who is a great coder if he could possibly make me a plugin to automated the process and leave it to the visitors to decide which posts would be best for the newbies.

I got lots of pretty damn good excuses for it but I&#8217;ll spare you of having to hear them. This week I&#8217;m back on the ball and I&#8217;m going to attempt to up my post volume to make up for the slack the last week and a half.</p> <p>Today&#8217;s post is a detailed way to deal with pesky hotlinkers. Hotlinkers are people who use your binary content and instead of hosting it themselves they just link directly to it on their site. I saw a funny article awhile back about a guy who threatened to sue another webmaster for removing the images he was hotlinking to on his server. That&#8217;s pretty funny stuff for anyone with half a brain, but there must of been a better way for the victim to get his rewards from the hotlinker instead of having to rename or remove the images. So true to tradition here at Blue Hat we&#8217;re going to look at some simple ways to not only stop them from hotlinking to your material but to try to get some of their visitors out of it as well. Personally I see hotlinking as a compliment. It means you have quality content. However there in lies the opportunity. If they are hotlinking to your content then their visitors must be of the similiar niche as yours. So I see no moral dilemma in trying to grab some of their visitors while politely letting them know that you don&#8217;t appreciate them sucking up your bandwidth. Let&#8217;s look at a few media formats and determine some ways to draw their visitors to your site using your .htaccess file. If you don&#8217;t know what a .htaccess file is please <a target="_blank" href="http://javascriptkit.com/howto/htaccess.shtml">go here</a> and do some reading.</p> <p><strong>Images</strong><br /> Images are the most commonly hotlinked to content so lets tackle them first. The trick here is to simply replace the image they are hotlinking to with an image that advertises your website. So make an image saying something like, &#8220;Go To www.MyDomain.com To View This Image.&#8221; Then name the file hotlinked.jpg and upload it to your server.<br /> Then add this to your .htaccess file<br /> RewriteEngine on<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mydomain.com/.*$      [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mydomain.com$      [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com/.*$      [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com$      [NC]<br /> RewriteRule .*\.(jpg|jpeg|gif|png|bmp)$ hotlinked.jpg [R,NC]</p> <p><strong>Flash Files</strong><br /> You have two options with flash. You could use the same method as the images and show a different flash file that displays an ad for your site. A more aggressive option might be to use the getURL() method inside the flash file and have it actually forward the user to your site. So your essentially hijacking any hotlinkers site or dare I say Myspace page. Create this file and name it hotlinked.swf then put this in your .htaccess file.<br /> RewriteEngine on<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mydomain.com/.*$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mydomain.com$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com/.*$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com$ [NC]<br /> RewriteRule [^hotlinked].(swf)$ http://www.mydomain.com/hotlinked.swf [R,NC]</p> <p><strong>Music</strong><br /> Sometimes sites users from MyPlaylist.org, Musiclist.us, and other sites will jack your mp3 files for their myspace pages and other sites. So its not a bad idea to have some fun and create a short audio advertisement for your site and put it into an mp3 file called hotlinked.mp3 then put this in your .htaccess file.<br /> RewriteEngine on<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^$<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mydomain.com/.*$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://mydomain.com$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com/.*$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com$ [NC]<br /> RewriteCond %{HTTP_REFERER} !^http://www.mydomain.com$ [NC]<br /> RewriteRule [^hotlinked].(mp3)$ http://www.mydomain.com/hotlinked.mp3 [R,NC] </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130511040936/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130511040936/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130511040936/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/dealing-with-those-pesky-hotlinkers/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/dealing-with-those-pesky-hotlinkers/"     dc:title="Dealing With Those Pesky Hotlinkers"     trackback:ping="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/dealing-with-those-pesky-hotlinkers/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/dealing-with-those-pesky-hotlinkers/#comments" title="Comment on Dealing With Those Pesky Hotlinkers">90 Comments &#187;</a></div>									</div> 							 				<div class="post"> 					<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/neat-tricks-and-hacks/" title="View all posts in Neat Tricks and Hacks" rel="category tag">Neat Tricks and Hacks</a></em>17 Dec 2006 08:36 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2"><b>Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Another one? Haha didn&#8217;t see that comin&#8217; did ya! If you haven&#8217;t already; be sure to read one of my favorite posts on <a href="/free-links-freebie-abandoned-wordpress-accounts/">Abandoned Wordpress Accounts</a> before continuing to read this post. Got it? Good! <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>So by now you&#8217;ve had about 6 months to hopefully grab at least a couple hundred already indexed and quality built Wordpress accounts. Good! You&#8217;ve also probably added links to your sites that could use a good IBL and page rank boost. Great! Your on your way except now we just need to convert these medium quality links into great links. Awesome! Lets get to it.</p> <p><strong>Recovery</strong><br /> First things first, we need to recover some abandoned content and lost links. Lookup your abandoned blogs on Archive.org and see if you can scrounge up some old posts. For some more recent ones you can do a linkdomain: on Yahoo or something. Then pull the cached copy of the individual posts. Repost them on your blogs and try to match the Post Slugs (the url to the post itself ie. myblog.wordpress.com/my-awesome-post). This will ensure that all the old links that exists to the blog and individual posts will still be giving you credit and traffic instead of going to an ugly 404. Also be sure to put up a post about how the blog got abandoned but out of kindness you reposted the old posts for the users&#8217; sake. How kind of you! This will also give the original owner a small opporunity to complain and ask you to take down the posts(don&#8217;t be a jerk do it if asked, no matter how small the chances are they will actually ask or care). This will keep everyone happy and preserve your linking and traffic.</p> <p><strong>Remodeling</strong><br /> A URL is just a URL. However a theme and topic is great link potential. Remodel the site to fit what kind of links you&#8217;re wanting. If your wanting tech news type links change up the keywords to match a technews type content. This&#8217;ll help transform your medium quality links to a semi-relevant stature.</p> <p><strong>Build</strong><br /> Now lets build some more relevant content as well as relevant IBL links to the blogs. This is where it gets interesting. Remember when I said to make a common Wordpress account and attach all your new blogs to the same account? If you didn&#8217;t take that advice you&#8217;re going to wish you did, because now we&#8217;re going to talk about how to get huge amounts of links and content to your blogs. Don&#8217;t worry it&#8217;ll be easy, it&#8217;ll be whitehat, and like the first part of the technique it also can be done completely by hand.</p> <p><strong>1)</strong> Go to Digg.com (Shoutwire also works) and signup with an account.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Go to your account settings and edit your blog settings. Put in your main login and password for your main Wordpress account. Digg will be kind enough to generate a nice list of all your blogs that are attached to that account next time you login. So in the future you can easily switch between them quickly.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Select your first blog and click update.</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> Search for that blogs terms and click &#8220;Blog It&#8221; on all the results. This will do three things. First it will grab the title and the description of the original post and insert it as a new post on your blog. You now got some great content. Secondly, it will post a trackback link on the original post. A percentage of the posts you grab will draw a huge number of backlinks to the original post which ups the quality of your trackback link. It&#8217;ll also drive some traffic(some of my abandoned blogs get over 200 visitors/day for this reason. Lastly this will give you a link on the Digg post itself under &#8220;Who blogged this.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Lets do the math</strong><br /> You got a couple hundred blogs. Each blog has a couple hundred posts. Each post has at least 2 backlinks. Add the previous inbound links + content. You got yourself hundreds of quality blogs driving traffic and link quality to your real money sites.</p> <p><strong>Life is good</strong> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130511040936/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130511040936/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130511040936/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/"     dc:title="Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2"     trackback:ping="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/#comments" title="Comment on Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2">107 Comments &#187;</a></div>									</div> 							 				<div class="post"> 					<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/neat-tricks-and-hacks/" title="View all posts in Neat Tricks and Hacks" rel="category tag">Neat Tricks and Hacks</a></em>30 Nov 2006 12:26 am</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/follow-up-google-search/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Follow Up- Google Search"><b>Follow Up- Google Search</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>I wanted to make a quick follow up on the <a href="/how-to-make-a-100-per-day/">$100/day post</a> in regards to monetizing the Google search. If you used the same screensaver program I use than this will be easy. If not then yo may need to make some modifications. Download any simple installer creation program. I&#8217;ve been using <a target="_blank" href="http://www.us.setupspecialist.com/en">Setup Specialist</a> for quite a few years now just because its super simple and quick. Create an installer for your screensaver. Copy over the self installing exe for the screensaver and then have it automatically execute immediately after the install finishes. There are two ways i know to pull some serious Google searches through your new install.</p> <p><strong>Desktop Search</strong><br /> This is the bit more technical way and since I have never actually done it I can&#8217;t go too specific on it. This will put a little google search box on their taskbar very similar to the Google Desktop Search. Go to <a rel="nofollow" href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/shellcc/platform/shell/programmersguide/shell_adv/bands.asp">Creating Custom Explorer Bars, Tool Bands, and Desk Bands</a> and create the toolband. Then in the registry add the toolband to the taskbar. Like I said i&#8217;ve never done it but it doesn&#8217;t seem too hard to figure out. Use the Google search box that is easily created in your Adsense account</p> <p><strong>Changing Their Homepage</strong><br /> Create a  small  website that is something like myhomepage.com or greatstartpage.com, it doesn&#8217;t really matter what the url is. Make a snazzy but simple template and include the google search box on the page. Use the google search box that is easily created in your adsense account. Then in your installer program change the registry key HKEY_CURRENT_USER\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Internet Explorer\Main\ change the &#8220;Start Page&#8221; to your new start page website address.</p> <p><strong>What will this do?</strong><br /> Everytime they search google you get proceeds from the adsense ads. As I&#8217;ll end up talking about in the upcoming Blue Hat Technique many internet users(especially the newbie ones) will never change their homepage. If it changes on them they will leave it. So you get small amounts of money over a very long period of time over massive amounts of users.</p> <p>I was going to avoid this topic due to the new Blue Hat Technique coming out, but since this is extra info that won&#8217;t be covered in the post I figured I might as well get it out of the way. </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130511040936/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130511040936/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130511040936/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/follow-up-google-search/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/follow-up-google-search/"     dc:title="Follow Up- Google Search"     trackback:ping="/web/20130511040936/http://www.bluehatseo.com/follow-up-google-search/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/follow-up-google-search/#comments" title="Comment on Follow Up- Google Search">99 Comments &#187;</a></div>									</div> 							 				<div class="post"> 					<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/neat-tricks-and-hacks/" title="View all posts in Neat Tricks and Hacks" rel="category tag">Neat Tricks and Hacks</a></em>18 Nov 2006 04:43 am</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/how-to-make-a-100-per-day/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: How to make a $100 per day"><b>How to make a $100 per day</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>I just realized something! This entire blog is filled with ideas on how to help your sites make more money and receive more traffic, but I don&#8217;t have a single post that says, <em>HEY! HERE IS HOW YOU MAKE MONEY</em>. I want a post that tells you <strong>exactly</strong> how to reach your goals. A comment in another post (I do read them and get inspired by them) reminded me of this. So I perused through some old projects of mine and grabbed one thats very easy, very automated, reciprocal (consistantly makes money forever), and makes about  a $100/day. Most of all it requires very minimal time and investment. So here ya go! Follow the instructions carefully and do as I did.<br /> <strong><br /> Here Is What You Do</strong><br /> <strong>1)</strong> Pick a generalized niche that is fairly popular. Celebrities work well, cars, animals. Anything will do.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Make a list of 300 items in that niche. For instance if you pick music artists make a list of the top 300 most popular music artists.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Download at least 20 public use(noncopyrighted) pictures of each item in your list.</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> Download or buy a screensaver maker. I don&#8217;t remember which one I use so I&#8217;ll have to update you in the comments when I get back to the office on Monday. Just make sure it is quick and easy to create the screensavers (saves you a lot of time) and comes with an exe output function that&#8217;ll easily install the screensavers on their computer without much dialog boxes or windows getting in thier way. This one looks decent. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.easy-screensaver-maker.com">Easy Screensaver Maker</a> and its only $25. <em>Update: I use <a target="_blank" href="http://www.download.com/Screen-Saver-Builder/3000-2409_4-10353859.html?tag=lst-0-1">Screen Saver Builder</a>. It&#8217;s $20 with fully functioning 21 day trial.</em><br /> <strong><br /> 5)</strong> Create all your screensavers and put them up on a simple website. Give each screensaver its own page and download link. It also never hurts to SEO the site so it&#8217;ll do well in the search engines and make you even more money later on. Adsense also doesn&#8217;t hurt for a lil&#8217; bit of extra cash.</p> <p><strong>6)</strong> Signup with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.zangocash.com/?ref_id=6219">Zangocash (Aff Link)</a>. <em>This step is optional. See the comments for more ideas on how to monenize your new screensavers.</em><br /> <strong><br /> 7)</strong> Talk to your account manager and ask him to bundle Zango software with your screensavers. Send him all the installers along with a textfile containing all the short descriptions and a sample picture. They are usually happy to do this for you. If they aren&#8217;t get a new account manager.<br /> <strong><br /> 8)</strong> Get yourself a copy of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.develab.net">Promosoft</a> software submitter(nonAff link). I think it costs $95 for a copy but trust me it&#8217;s well worth it.</p> <p><strong>9)</strong> Follow the instructions on Promosoft to create the PAD files(product description files used for software sites) and submit each screensaver to hundreds of software and screensaver directories.</p> <p>There you go. You will get paid $0.45 for every person who installs your screensaver. Once the screensavers are submitted you will have no problem getting tons of people downloading them everyday. If you get about 250 downloads per day(easy with 300 screensavers) you will easily make about a $100/day!</p> <p><em>Okay so now all those people on forums and such who are bitching and moaning; saying stuff like &#8220;I want to quit my day job&#8221; and &#8220;I wish I could make a living online&#8221; can finally shut up. It is all right there, spelled out in plain english. You now have absolutely no excuses. Get off your ass and actually do it. Follow each step carefully and do a good job. It should take the average person no more than a couple days to get it done and you will make continuous money for a very long time. If you&#8217;re reading this and you suddenly realize that you are one of those people, just know that there is nothing wrong with that. We were all there. You just have to know when to quit. Quit searching forums  for ideas. Quit buying ebooks hoping they&#8217;ll give that magical $100/day project idea. Quit asking &#8220;SEO experts&#8221; how they do it, and for God&#8217;s sake quit reading blogs hoping someone will post something like this, cus it just ain&#8217;t gonna happen(haha).  All I expect from you is to read this post throughly and carefully at least two more times and actually follow through. There is nothing more I would love, than to hear someone tell me that an article I wrote helped them quit their job in the next 8 weeks. So make it happen!<br /> </em></p> <p><strong>Good Luck and Lets Get Back To Some SEO Shall We?</strong></p> <p>Update 3/20/07: The comments for this post are getting semi-ridiculous <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  So a nice user has setup a forum especially for this post, where it can be discussed in a more efficient manner.
