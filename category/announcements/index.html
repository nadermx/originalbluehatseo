This launch went crazy good. In fact it was downright record setting. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>We almost double sold out in 2mins 21 seconds. We managed to stop the registrations at about 250 members(The tool can easily handle more than that). The server looks great, even though it underwent what can easily be considered a digg effect X5. Thanks to everyone who sent in reports of anything not working. We fixed them all and a few minor changes will be made to make sure everything is in perfect working order.</p> <p>Couple things:<br /> The domain errors was a result of not being able to find the whois information for a domain. This was fixed but some bugs may possibly remain with .co.uk and .c* domains until further notice.</p> <p>Most of the accounts have been activated and been made to full member status. If your account isn&#8217;t activated by tomorrow please send an email to rob [at] robstool.com with your account email and paypal email information.</p> <p>If you accidentally double paid through paypal, just email rob [at] robstool.com and let us know your account email and paypal email and we&#8217;ll make sure your account gets activated and properly credited.</p> <p>The analysis tool is 100% free and uses no credits. So go ahead and use it at will, if you don&#8217;t have a subscription just create a guest account and you will still be able to use it.</p> <p>The bunny in the logo is my real life bunny named Roady. He&#8217;s a 4lb fully grown 5 month old dwarf rabbit. He is potty trained, loves people, and makes the best mascot ever. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>If You Missed The Registration</strong><br /> Send a blank email to waiting [at] robstool.com. This will automatically add you to the waiting list. Then as slots open up we will systematically move through the list on a first come first serve basis and give out invites to those next in line.</p> <p>I&#8217;m always open to constructive criticisms. If you have any suggestions or feature requests definitely let me know. Any ideas to make this subscription gain value month to month is more than welcome.</p> <p>Also, many people want a private forum here. This is being moled over however most of you already know that I am adamantly against people paying for SEO information. However, this place has a huge amount of very very smart readers, and I think a place where the readers here<br /> can network with each other and share ideas privately would be great. So in the next couple days I will be opening a chatroom up. It&#8217;d also be really nice to meet some of you and get to talk to you outside of email.</p> <p>Thanks so much and enjoy,<br /> Eli</p> <p>PS. Sorry for the long string of announcements.

I&#8217;m not personally against the idea of it (I am an Internet marketer after all) but I&#8217;ve been holding out for a really good idea of how exactly to do it. I don&#8217;t want to just throw up some banners or become super lame by getting people to signup through my Algco account (kidding! I don&#8217;t do MLM schemes). I also would NEVER dream of putting the information here on a paid model. I want to monotenize it in a way that <strong>directly makes people money and helps them become more successful</strong>. That&#8217;s obviously easier pitched than done. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  But I think I came up with a good solution of how to do it.</p> <p>Since the release of the <a href="/quit-quick-indexing-tool/">Quick Indexing Tool</a> I&#8217;ve gotten a lot of requests from people to buy access to my own personal tools. I&#8217;m really happy with the way <a href="/quit-quick-indexing-tool/">QUIT</a> turned out. It&#8217;s been thoroughly put through the ringer by over 50 bloggers and popular forums as well as thousands of readers here and has more than proven itself.  It has finally been PROVEN to the industry that not only is it possible to get indexed in less than 24 hours but it can be done as easily as filling out a very short four part form and clicking a button. The concept actually goes one step further than that. Rankings can be just as easily acquired and admittedly for my own ego&#8217;s sake I want to prove to the industry that not only is it possible but anyone can do it.</p> <p><strong>So Here&#8217;s What&#8217;s Going To Happen</strong><br /> Sometime within a week I will be releasing a subscription based access to a version of my own personal toolset. The subscription will cost $100/month (canceling will be allowed anytime and none of your personalized data on your account will be deleted).</p> <p><strong>Here&#8217;s what the subscribers will get</strong><br /> <strong>1.</strong> SQUIRT- Super Quick Indexing and Ranking Tool.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> Does everything <a href="/quit-quick-indexing-tool/">QUIT</a> does but even more efficiently, also includes a ton of extra social bookmarking sites. Including the virgin ones that no tools as of yet has the skills to automate submissions to.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> Gets your site deep indexed faster. So not only will your main page go in faster but the rest of your site will get indexed faster and more efficiently.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>C.</strong> Utilizes many of the techniques talked about here automatically. This includes Rollover sites, third party sitemaps, keyword real estate and several others that I haven&#8217;t even talked about yet. NONE of which can possibly get you banned or penalized. You are perfectly safe using this tool.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>D.</strong> Deep analysis of your site. The tool looks at every possible ranking factor you can think of; including both onsite and offsite. It then rates your site on a  percentage scale. 100% of course being the perfect site with perfect existing promotion(none exist that i&#8217;ve managed to find yet) and 1% being essentially brand new site with no promotion and horrible onsite factors. The analysis tool is an exact clone of the same one I use. It is all 100% custom and I use it everyday to analyze my sites as well as my competitions. As far as SEO analysis tools go it&#8217;s about as accurate as it gets.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>E.</strong> Custom promotion. After analyzing your site and current levels of promotion the tool determines your weaknesses and strong points and automatically determines the perfect promotional campaign you will need to reach the top 10. There are literally thousands of different combinations the tool can go from there to determine the absolute perfect path to success for any given site. Can you guess what it does with this information?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>F.</strong> It promotes your site. It uses it&#8217;s analysis to determine what techniques are needed to get you ranking in the top 10 and it automatically does them. The whole process from the time you fill out the two part form (URL and up to 3 keywords/phrases you are wanting to rank for) takes less than 3 minutes to run. So in other words you can build a site and have it promoted perfectly and precisely within a couple minutes. Sorry skeptics, there&#8217;s no B.S. here <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>2.</strong> X amount of submissions/day will be allowed<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> You will be allowed so many submissions a day through the tool. We haven&#8217;t quite worked out what the numbers will be yet, but they will be more than ample for the high producing webmaster, and at the same time low enough so the tool doesn&#8217;t get overly saturated.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> I&#8217;m only going to allow 100 members. With the obvious power behind the tool I can&#8217;t let every Joe Schmoe play around with it. As neat as this tool is, it is definitely no toy and the use of it needs to be taken seriously.  Which is why I&#8217;m giving you guys the first heads up. I know once I release it several large forums and blogs will catch wind, and while thats all fair I am personally biased with the Blue Hat readers. So I&#8217;m letting everyone here know in advanced. So if you&#8217;re interested in joining, be on the look out and if this site isn&#8217;t already in your reader or live bookmarks be sure to add it, because idealy I want you guys to have the first crack at it.  Than if there are any extra slots others are welcome to it. This tool is for you after all not them.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Access to my personal content club<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> I&#8217;m going to be throwing up a HUGE collection of custom databases and scripts for you to download and use at will. They will all be free with the subscription. After all, what good is a tool that helps you mass promote a ton of sites quickly if you can&#8217;t easily produce sites just as quickly and easily. So I really want to help people build their networks and become more powerful in their markets. I think a private content club will be the perfect way to do that.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>B.</strong> I also am cutting a deal with a good friend of mine (and avid reader here) to continually produce databases. He is incredibly talented at collecting high quality data and he sells his databases for big bucks. However since he&#8217;s a reader and commenter here he&#8217;s been cool enough to join in and help everyone out. So we&#8217;ll see what kind of deal we can cut so he can get paid for his work while at the same time getting to help you guys out with more quality data than you can handle.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Discounts on Blue Hat Tools.<br /> &nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>A.</strong> A lot of posts here require custom coding. I&#8217;ve always encouraged programmers to join in and code my techniques for the readers here and sell them through the comments. I think thats a great way to not only reward the people who create the scripts and share them but to help the nontechnical people get their hands on the tools and scripts they wouldn&#8217;t be able to any other way. However there have been several large unforeseen problems this has caused. I have no idea who is trying to rip off my readers and who is legit. grrr. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' />  So this way I&#8217;m going to team up with my own personal highly talented programmers and giving them heads up on all my upcoming posts that require custom scripts made. So when the techniques get posted here, you can log into your account and buy the script for a hugely discounted price.</p> <p><strong>What To Expect As Far As Ranking Capabilities</strong><br /> The tool is designed to rank a site within the top 10 for most medium and small sized niches. All the promotion in the world of course can&#8217;t rank a poorly designed site so that part is of course left up to you. However with adequate onsite SEO the tool by itself should be able to perform quite well within most medium sized niches alone. I also encourage everyone to test that for themselves.</p> <p>So there you go. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  If you&#8217;re interested, keep your head up. It&#8217;ll be coming within about a week or less. I&#8217;ll post it here first and it&#8217;ll be hosted on a another server of mine as well as the blog of my business partner(an awesome programmer). I&#8217;ll be honest, I&#8217;m kind of scared of selling out and I&#8217;m even more scared of hyping something and having it not turn out to be as great as people were hoping. So please feel free to help me out with this. I really want to hear your opinions and ideas of what you would like to see to make this tool/club be of even more value to you. I want the $100/month to be pennies compared to what people actually get, so anything you can think of to make it even more badass let me know.</p> <p>Thanks,<br /> Eli </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130506101919/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130506101919/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130506101919/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130506101919/http://www.bluehatseo.com/a-few-quick-announcements/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130506101919/http://www.bluehatseo.com/a-few-quick-announcements/"     dc:title="A Few Quick Announcements"     trackback:ping="/web/20130506101919/http://www.bluehatseo.com/a-few-quick-announcements/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/a-few-quick-announcements/#comments" title="Comment on A Few Quick Announcements">153 Comments &#187;</a></div>									</div> 							 				<div class="post"> 					<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/announcements/" title="View all posts in Announcements" rel="category tag">Announcements</a></em>01 Apr 2007 10:55 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/podcast-elite-free-seo-help/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Podcast Elite - Free SEO Help"><b>Podcast Elite - Free SEO Help</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>My buddy <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jonwaraas.com">Jon Waraas</a> and I will be doing an exclusive podcast tomorrow(Mon. 4/2/07) to chat it up and address people&#8217;s SEO questions.

As tradition states with most blogs before me I&#8217;m supposed to post some impressive stats about the blog and say how big the site has grown in an effort to grab some attention of some private advertisers and to impress and wow everyone in between. However, anyone who is already familiar with this place knows that this is simply is not how i operate or think.  Instead I would love nothing more than to accomplish what normally would of been accomplished on the very first post. I would like to explain this site. Why is it here? Why do I do it? Where is it headed? Since the beginning I have tried to keep this blog very focused, straying only for the sake of humor. So when the opportunity presents itself. I&#8217;m going to take it.<br /> <strong><br /> So Here Are Some Things You Probably Don&#8217;t Know About Me And BlueHatSEO</strong></p> <p><strong>How Did BlueHatSEO Get Started?</strong><br /> I&#8217;ve always been very independent in the SEO world. I&#8217;ve never really read SEO sites, nor am I very active in the SEO community. I viewed the industry like I would a game. I could go find some walkthroughs and ruin all the fun or I could go out and do my own research and testing and defeat it on my own. About a year ago I finally got curious of what others were up to and started becoming a bit more active in the industry. Honestly within a week I was bored to tears. The industry didn&#8217;t seem to have changed a bit since back in the days when self proclaimed gurus were telling everyone the keys to success online were simply to submit their sites to the search engines and post on some Free For All Link sites. So the wacko crackpot in me came out swinging with his crazy jibberish talk. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  It didn&#8217;t really result in anything until one day when I was bitching to a friend about how boring blogs are when he said something along the lines of &#8220;well you talk about some crazy good shit. You should create a blog and show &#8216;em how its done.&#8221; That statement didn&#8217;t really settle in until the next day when I happened to of seen a quote by Muhammad Ghandi on a stamp of all things that said, &#8220;Be the change you want to see in the world.&#8221; I thought about it for a moment, and that was that. I was determined to make some waves in the SEO world. Blue Hat SEO was born. Nothing grand nothing notable, but there it was none the less.<br /> <strong><br /> What&#8217;s With The New Hat Color Con Polluting My Nice Monochrome Universe?</strong><br /> People tell me all the time that &#8220;Blue must be your favorite color.&#8221; Actually blue is my least favorite color. If we&#8217;re going to get personal about it, green is my favorite. Blue is simply a random color picked off the top of my head. Nothing more nothing less. The blue hat represents the idea of Advanced SEO. I really don&#8217;t mean to conpollute the whole white hat, blackhat and gray hat understanding. I just use it to represent the fact that what you read here is so off the wall and different it can&#8217;t be classified properly. Its just simply different.<br /> <strong><br /> Why Am I Doing All This?</strong><br /> I&#8217;m not doing this to be cool or bring any form of fame to myself. I&#8217;m not some kind of lame masked magician dispelling secrets. I don&#8217;t want to be renown and respected in the industry. Infact when all is said and done I should be able to leave back to the SEO shadows just as quietly as I came. I have absolutely no interest in self promotion or the copious amounts of money involved with having the attention of webmasters. I want simply one single thing. Other bloggers to mimic me. If I get my way, and I usually do, in the near future someone wanting to make some money off their webmaster peers won&#8217;t be able to put up some blog, post about boring new google products, and post a picture of themselves with a big check and get anyone to listen. People won&#8217;t be considered experts because they got a couple other experts to vouch for them. They won&#8217;t be able to become popular by doing constant circle jerk interviews(where one person interviews another only so they can be interviewed later by them). There will be only one way to establish yourself as an expert, and that will be to truly know your stuff. I believe this isn&#8217;t as impossible as it sounds. All it takes is one blogger showing two or three others that sharing and actually helping people isn&#8217;t so bad or as scary as it seems. Thats all it takes to create a new standard of quality. The rest in my opinion will spread like cancer on its own. Than before you know it, SEO experts will be judged on what they have to say and the quality of their writings NOT what they claim. I live firmly by the rule that if you can&#8217;t explain something in a way that the average Joe can understand, than you don&#8217;t really understand it all that well yourself. If I fail at everything and accomplish only one thing with this blog I want to <strong>prove</strong> that the viral idea of &#8220;I make too much money to share my techniques&#8221; <strong>IS A LIE!</strong></p> <p><strong>How Far Am I On My Goals?</strong><br /> I&#8217;m nowhere close to where I want it to be but the progress thus far has been nothing short of AMAZING. Don&#8217;t believe me? Check out my blogroll.<br /> Here&#8217;s a few highlights. I know I&#8217;m missing some big ones and for that I&#8217;m sorry. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.earnersblog.com/methods/make-200-dollars-every-day" /></p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.earnersblog.com/methods/make-200-dollars-every-day">How To Make $200/day</a> - I&#8217;m going to go take my Ovaltine cus I just got 0wned with this awesome technique. Its natural to question my <a target="_blank" href="/how-to-make-a-100-per-day/">$100/day post</a> because there obviously must be a catch. Nope! I gave up a $100/day technique, poof its gone. Someone, who I&#8217;d like to think was inspired by it, posted back a $200/day technique. The way I see it is, thats a damn good ROI. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Its not a competition its progress and we all win.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.netbusinessblog.com/2007/01/12/domaining-101-researching-keywords"><br /> Domaining 101</a> -  This isn&#8217;t your average &#8220;buy a domain with your keywords in it&#8221; article. Another great thing about this article is that its developed throughout a series. Thats great for both the readers and the writer. For the readers it gives them something to continuously think about and develop on their own. For the writer it forces you to think before you speak. You really have to develop an idea not just post your opinions. I think more bloggers should learn from posts like this.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monetizetraffic.com/how-to-get-free-content-for-your-blog-set-it-and-forget-it-blogging/2006/12"><br /> How To Get Free Content For Your Blog</a> - A great example of a big change I&#8217;ve been wanting to see in the industry. Don&#8217;t just plug a tool! Explain it, show it, and report back with the results. Anything else is bullshit.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://helpwebmasters.com/info/domain-kiting-secrets-revealed-my-formula-for-success"><br /> Domain Kiting Secrets Revealed</a> - Also a very well accepted featured repost on Blue Hat for obvious reasons. Its damn good! Posts like this are exactly what I want to see everywhere.</p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://megalomanix.com/seo/free-deep-links-via-rss-feeds.html">Free Deep Links VIA RSS Feeds</a> - This is what I like to see. Plausible and actually usable ideas. Nothing better, enough said.</p> <p>This is just a few examples of posts and blogs I&#8217;m seeing pop up on the underground all the time. I get about 2-3 emails a week from people wanting to show me their new posts that they are proud of. Its quality like this that the SEO industry has no choice but to bow to. I&#8217;m seeing more and more people all around taking actual pride in their posts and what they share with the community. It&#8217;s a great thing in my opinion and its only going to gain momentum. I&#8217;m feeling lucky button be damned(inside joke).<br /> <strong><br /> Whats In The Future For Blue Hat SEO?</strong><br /> Expect me, and a couple of my friends, to attempt to set some standards in the SEO tools industry. If you search for &#8220;rank checker&#8221; in Google right now there are about 1.3 MILLION results. With all the extremely talented programmers out there I can&#8217;t imagine why the same three or four SEO tool ideas keep getting recycled endlessly. I probably won&#8217;t be the one to change all that, but I at least want to waste the next year of my life proposing the possibility of creating SEO tools that work outside of the conventional box and making them available for public use. Where there&#8217;s a will theres a way.</p> <p>I also plan on fighting hard for every single post to have SOME value to it. Even if the post is just for a laugh I&#8217;ll put forth some effort into inserting something you can use or refer to. I may not be completely successful at this but hey blame the ADD <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>Whats Not In The Future For Blue Hat SEO</strong><br /> I got a few traditions I&#8217;ll continue to stand by firmly in the next year.<br /> <strong>1) No Linkbait -</strong> For as long as this blog stands I will never make a post for the sake of linkbait. To me link bait posts are like cutting all the awesome violence and sex scenes out of a good movie so it can get a PG13 rating and reach a bigger audience.</p> <p><strong>2) No Interviews -</strong> I will never do an interview with someone who isn&#8217;t willing to give out a technique or two. Anything but is nothing more than shameless self and product promotion.  I understand that this rule will more than likely mean no interviews at all, but if thats the way the cookie crumbles, so be it. For me interviews are like masturbation, if others are forced to watch than you might as well put on a show; otherwise keep it to yourself.</p> <p><strong>What Are My Recommended Must-Read Posts For 2006?</strong><br /> <a href="/bluehatseo-technique-3-easy-pr5-1200-1-way-links/">Easy PR5: 1,200 oneway backlinks</a> - This post broke the ground on what I was willing to give away. Whenever I&#8217;m deciding on whether or not to publicize one of my techniques I compare it to this post before making my decision.</p> <p><a href="/top-seo-secrets/">Top SEO Secrets</a> - By the far the funniest post I&#8217;ve ever had the pleasure of experiencing.

For any blogger this is definitely a brag worthy subject. This isn&#8217;t a suck up post it&#8217;s to let everyone know how much I appreciate it. So I feel I have every right to be cocky in this manner and brag for at least one post. This may not be the most popular blog in the sphere but I&#8217;ll be damned if it doesn&#8217;t have the best feedback. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>I was reading some other, more mainstream, SEO blogs this morning and I gotta say just the difference in the insight and intelligence of the readers&#8217; comments are amazing. On other sites they tend to just agree or disagree with a post or blurt out whatever random ass emotion they&#8217;re feeling at the moment. Over here theres a trend of critiquing and research every aspect of the post. People tend to ask the questions everyone else is thinking and what future readers are bound to ask. Then the questions are usually answered intelligently by two or three different people citing their own research and facts. Problems and ambiguities tend to be solved in the same manner. Not to mention; the <a href="/easy-contributions/">reader contributions</a> have been BADASS so far. I gotta say YOU GUYS/GALS KICK ASS!</p> <p>In light of this I just put up a neat plugin I found called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pfadvice.com/wordpress-plugins/show-top-commentators">Show Top Commentators</a> as a way of thanking the people who comment often. It&#8217;ll post the names of the top 10 global commentators as well as a link to their websites (if applicable) on the navigation. Likewise, this is old news, but I also removed all <a href="/my-external-links/">nofollow links</a> in the comments. So now the people who comment can get properly rewarded with links and the people who comment most can get rewarded even more. Personally I&#8217;d rather do what I can to improve the community here rather than my own faggy Page Rank.</p> <p>I know there are plenty of lurkers still on this site (about 1,600 and growing daily to be exact) that I would love to get commenting on a regular basis. So if you&#8217;re a lurker by all means if you got some questions or insight on a post feel compelled to let us know and help everyone out by leaving a quick comment. Likewise if you&#8217;re not in the habit of reading comments on blogs than I&#8217;d recommend you make an exception here because you&#8217;re missing a ton of great information if you don&#8217;t. The rest of you; You really are making this an awesome place so keep it up because we all appreciate it! I know I&#8217;ve learned a ton from you guys already.</p> <p><strong>Thanks!</strong> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130506101919/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130506101919/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130506101919/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130506101919/http://www.bluehatseo.com/top-commentators/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130506101919/http://www.bluehatseo.com/top-commentators/"     dc:title="Top Commentators"     trackback:ping="/web/20130506101919/http://www.bluehatseo.com/top-commentators/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/top-commentators/#comments" title="Comment on Top Commentators">189 Comments &#187;</a></div>									</div> 							 				<div class="post"> 					<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/announcements/" title="View all posts in Announcements" rel="category tag">Announcements</a></em>01 Dec 2006 02:44 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/easy-contributions/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Easy Contributions"><b>Easy Contributions</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Hey I found this awesome new WP plugin that allows users to easily contribute and write articles for a blog.
