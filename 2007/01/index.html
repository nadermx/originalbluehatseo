It was a lot of fun, but this time I feel like stepping it up a notch and going a bit more new wave. This time focusing on the money sites, which you can probably guess is my favorite type of site. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>The trick to a good money site is its ability to convert, draw traffic, and get indexed. Hmmm&#8230; I could of swore I just missed one&#8230;.Oh yeah! and be automated.  This is where Madlib Sites come to the rescue.</p> <p><strong>What Are Madlib Sites?</strong><br /> Madlib Sites are basically the perfect combination of selling a product or offer through through standard SEO using a prewritten madlib and a big frickin&#8217; database. You are probably already familiar with what a madlib is. Its a game kids play where you get asked to name a series of objects off the top of your head. For instance, say a girls name(okay Sally), now say a noun(okay Rock). Then you get a story with a bunch of blanks like *girlsname* jumped over a large *noun*. Then you insert your choices into the blanks where appropriate. So you end up with something like, &#8220;Sally jumped over a large rock.&#8221; In the SEO world this is typically known as a content rewriter. However rewriting is not what we&#8217;re going to be using this technique for. We&#8217;re going to use it to sell the users on a targeted product or offer. When done in mass this equates to some serious niche coverage and I&#8217;ll explain how.</p> <p><strong>Lets Get Started</strong><br /> <strong>1)</strong> First we&#8217;ll need to pick a broad niche. Lets go with dating. Dating is a nice CPA type offer that tends to convert well if you can throw it in the face of the right type of lonely people. I&#8217;d say that fits just about 90% of the people using Google at this moment so lets go for them.</p> <p><strong>2) </strong>Next we&#8217;re going to pick some offers. There&#8217;s a million and a half blogs talking about how to pick CPA offers so I&#8217;m going skip all that rubbish and just go for a good ol&#8217; Singlesnet affiliate offer and possibly an old FriendFinder banner or two.<br /> <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/datingexample.jpg" /><br /> <em>Haha. You probably had no idea Oregon was farming such damn fine honeys did ya? <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Now we just need to get our hands on a good database. You can find plenty of large databases for sale at public forums like Sitepoint. For this example I&#8217;m going to grab a good regional database. A regional database usually contains a bunch of regional information such as city, zip, county, population, local restaurants, gas stations, schools, and other census and GPS information.</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> Next we&#8217;ll throw up a site with the general niche as the primary keyword. The main page will give a nice description of the site and how to find local dating. It will then give a directory of all the states. Inside each states subpage will be links to even more subpages of the cities and counties. This is best done through ModRewrite and pulling from the database in an ORDER BY. For instance if the database is organized like:<br /> State    County    City<br /> Then we would have the subpages ORDER BY STATE, then each county subpage would be organized WHERE STATE = $state and so on and so forth for the individual cities. For those of you who don&#8217;t live in the United States that basically means we now have one big ass site with thousands of landing pages for each individual city and county.</p> <p><strong>5)</strong> Here comes the fun part, creating our madlib. Using as little of your own words as possible write an entire page about dating in *cityname*. The trick here is to really make it sell your dating offers. Also be sure to use as much of the database content as possible so the pages don&#8217;t look like duplicate content. Since I love (pun) this step so much I&#8217;m going to write a short example to get started.</p> <p><strong>-begin madlib page-</strong><br /> You look lonely. There now little fella don&#8217;t be lonely there are plenty of singles in *cityname*. I realize its tough to meet people in the *countyname* area, but luckily I found *datingsitelink*. I met an awesome *guysname* that worked at *gasstation*. He impregnated me and we moved to Europe where he&#8217;s in mergers and aquisitions for a large company. Since then I have recommended all my friends join a good dating site like *datingsitelink*. Here&#8217;s a few of my girlfriends who are still living in *city* that joined *datingsitelink*. All three were my best friends growing up and going to *localhighschool*.<br /> <img src="/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/datingexample.jpg" /><br /> The best advice I can give for scoring big points white dating in *cityname* is to pick a nice romantic restaurant. I&#8217;d recommend you check out *restaurant1* or possibly *restaurant2*.<br /> <strong>-End madlib page-</strong></p> <p>That was fun wasn&#8217;t it! Hehe. Just remember that there is a perfect balance you must find. So feel free to play around with your madlibs before going live with it. Use as much of the database as possible in order to escape duplicate content penalties, yet at the same time using enough of your own words to really sell the product thoroughly. Also don&#8217;t forget to plaster the margins with banners and advertisements for the offers but not enough to distract them heavily from the text because its the text that&#8217;s going to drive the conversion through.</p> <p><strong>6)</strong> Next we&#8217;ll need to write out the individual pages script for each city and county using the madlib. For you noncoders, don&#8217;t worry about hiring a coder to do this, its so incredibly simple. Learn a tiny bit of php or perl (like some echo or print functions) and a few SELECT and sorting commands in MYSQL and you should have it up with hardly any effort.</p> <p>So now you got yourself a clean 40,000+ page lean mean selling machine. Now you just got to use your <a href="/blue-hat-technique-16-link-laundering-sites/">Link Laundering Sites</a> to generate some heaving deep linking to your landing pages to help them get indexed and ranking. From this point on its all about SEO volume. It&#8217;s also good to notice the huge variants in the niches, offers, and available databases that can be used using the Madlib Site technique. Although not alone, regional is a great example because regional is so expansive and yet contains VERY targeted traffic. The volume also follows suite. There are a lot of golden niches that can be found when you combine a large niche with a large targeted database. You may be shocked what what you find. Not convinced? Do a little keyword research on &#8220;online dating Louisville&#8221;.<br /> <em><br /> Those of you that are still wondering how people are managing to make to make thousands a day online and consistantly through the fads I hope you are starting to come to an understanding</em> <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100121/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100121/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100121/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/madlib-sites/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/madlib-sites/"     dc:title="Madlib Sites"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/madlib-sites/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/madlib-sites/#comments" title="Comment on Madlib Sites">306 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/blue-hat-techniques/" title="View all posts in Blue Hat Techniques" rel="category tag">Blue Hat Techniques</a></em>27 Jan 2007 02:03 am</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/blue-hat-technique-16-link-laundering-sites/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Blue Hat Technique #16 - Link Laundering Sites"><b>Blue Hat Technique #16 - Link Laundering Sites</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Alrighty so we&#8217;re going to go a bit old school today with this technique. Link laundering is an old technique that the pros have been using aggressively in tight circles since around 2001. So it&#8217;s nothing new, but it works damn well. A true Internet marketing professional doesn&#8217;t just focus on building their money making sites, they expend a lot of energy on building their link gathering power, and thats exactly what this technique does. If used properly this technique will allow you to automatically gather unlimited links over time to any present and future projects you produce. This is where the true beauty lies. It allows you to cut your mass link gathering time for each project dramatically so you have more time for developing other projects.</p> <p><strong>Objective</strong><br /> What we&#8217;re going to do is create a network of third party link laundering sites that will give other developers an incentive to link to our primary money making sites instead of back to our link laundering sites. We&#8217;re going to use these sites to our advantage by automating the process of distributing their inbound link gathering abilities to push links to our primary site networks. Don&#8217;t worry it&#8217;s easier than it sounds. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>What Is A Link Laundering Site?</strong><br /> Simply, A Link Laundering site is a niche site that requires a link back from other webmasters except that the link back it requires is for another site of yours instead of the site itself.</p> <p><strong>Methodology</strong><br /> First we&#8217;re going to want to grab a solid platform for our link laundering sites. There are literally unlimited ideas on how to accomplish this, all you have to do is come up with some ideas on how to get webmasters to link back to your site. The reality of this is the fact that any site with a link exchange script will work, but since our focus is on drawing large link volume we&#8217;ll have to get a bit creative. This requires some brainstorming but to get you started I&#8217;ll list an example and we can get creative from there. One idea would be to create your own software download directory. Software download directories are great. They require very little promotion before they spread to all the software submitters and they tend to get a lot of high pagerank software sites that want to submit their software to your directory for the backlink and promotion. With minimal advertising and perhaps a link in DMOZ you should start getting at least a couple dozen submissions a day to your software directory. First you&#8217;ll have to build one though. You can get a free script for this from the <a target="_blank" href="http://www.asp-shareware.org">Association of Shareware Professionals</a>. They are the ones who regulate shareware directories and pad file standards(pad files are the files that describe your software). They offer a free one called Pad Kit. On a side note you&#8217;ll notice that they discontinued the distribution of Pad Kit so its nearly impossible to find a recent copy. So I&#8217;m going to share mine since it is probably the only working copy available to download until they come out with a new version. God knows when that will be. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_sad.gif' alt=':(' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><a href="/wp-content/uploads/2007/01/padkit.zip"><strong>Download Pad Kit v2.00.09</strong></a></p> <p>Next you&#8217;ll need to do a bit of modifying to the submit.php(the page they go to to submit their software info). Make it require a link back in order for the submission to go through. Make sure to inform the submitter that they will need to place the link on their site before the &#8220;pad file&#8221; submission will go through and give them an input to put in the url to where your link back is located. Be sure to give them an easy textarea with the html already for them to copy and paste into their site. This should be simple enough. This is also where it gets interesting and we turn this simple software directory into a link laundering site. Create a mysql or flatfile(textfile) database on another domain. Inside that database put in the urls, anchor text, and link count(start with default value of 0) of your real money sites. Have the submit.php pull the database before they go to submit. Have it grab the link with the lowest link count and put that as the link info. In other words in order to submit their software to your site they will first need to link to www.MyMoneySite1.com. You&#8217;re finally starting to see where this is going aren&#8217;t you? *evil grin*</p> <p>So after a couple months or so with a tad bit of advertising your software directory will start getting a ton of daily submissions. Some will be manual and some will be through automated or semiautomated software. For instance Robosoft, Robosoft is a semiautomated way. Its all done manually but it fills the forms for you. They usually specify in advanced where they will be placing any links from the directories that require them. Then they place the links as they go down the list. Others automatically generate the link pages for you based on the linkback criteria of the individual software sites in their database. Then they just upload the link page to their sites and boom your done. The automated ones kind of suck because often times the page they upload just sits on their sites with no internal linking and won&#8217;t ever make it into the search engines. In which case record all the linkpages that get submitted to you. Then submit those pages to search engines for them. Boom your links are in! hehe</p> <p>There ya go. You got yourself a link laundering site that sits there and distributes anywhere from a couple dozen to a couple hundred links a day to your real money making sites automatically. Don&#8217;t forget to put ads on your link laundering sites so it can at least pay for its own hosting while it boosts your other sites.<br /> <strong><br /> It Doesn&#8217;t Have To Be This Complicated</strong><br /> The software directory example is a tad complicated and requires a bit of experience. It&#8217;s great because it easily generates a good solid volume of links, but its really more of an example of a type of link laundering site a pro might create. I suggest starting smaller and simpler. As stated above any site with a link exchange section will work. You could easily generate a few niche sites with some Wiki-worthy articles and just put in a link exchange script. Then just modify the link exchange script so the backlink it requires from the user is for your money sites listed in the database instead of the niche site itself. A great example of how to create these type of sites is in my <a href="/how-to-create-your-own-autoresponder-network/">How To Create Your Own Autoresponder Network</a> post. Feel free to let the creativity juice flow with this one. Just think volume volume volume. The more links you can automatically generate daily to your money sites through your link laundering site network the better. It&#8217;ll take some serious time but trust me, IT PAYS BIG TIME IN THE END.</p> <p>If you really start dedicating yourself to building your linking power by developing link laundering sites you&#8217;ll start seeing some serious results in the promotion of your money making sites. It also makes your life a lot easier when promoting future projects. You can just create a new money site and put it into your central database. From there it&#8217;ll automatically start getting inbound links for as long as you keep it in there. Also, once you approach the 10,000 links or so a day mark you can start bartering with your buddies. &#8220;Alright I&#8217;ll give your network 50 links/day if you&#8217;ll give me 50 links/day with your link laundering network.&#8221; This has the added benefit of being able to nitpick your niches. So if your buddy has a bunch of Niche-A related link laundering sites and you have a bunch of Niche-B related laundering sites you can trade generated links for your Niche-A related projects. Like I said, this technique is nothing new, people have been creating link laundering networks for years. Might as well get started having them work for you <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100121/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100121/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100121/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/blue-hat-technique-16-link-laundering-sites/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/blue-hat-technique-16-link-laundering-sites/"     dc:title="Blue Hat Technique #16 - Link Laundering Sites"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/blue-hat-technique-16-link-laundering-sites/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/blue-hat-technique-16-link-laundering-sites/#comments" title="Comment on Blue Hat Technique #16 - Link Laundering Sites">431 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/random-thoughts/" title="View all posts in Random Thoughts" rel="category tag">Random Thoughts</a></em>19 Jan 2007 03:57 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/awstats-hacks/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Awstats Hacks"><b>Awstats Hacks</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Thought I might share a neat Awstats hack of mine that I use to read my referer data better.

As tradition states with most blogs before me I&#8217;m supposed to post some impressive stats about the blog and say how big the site has grown in an effort to grab some attention of some private advertisers and to impress and wow everyone in between. However, anyone who is already familiar with this place knows that this is simply is not how i operate or think.  Instead I would love nothing more than to accomplish what normally would of been accomplished on the very first post. I would like to explain this site. Why is it here? Why do I do it? Where is it headed? Since the beginning I have tried to keep this blog very focused, straying only for the sake of humor. So when the opportunity presents itself. I&#8217;m going to take it.<br /> <strong><br /> So Here Are Some Things You Probably Don&#8217;t Know About Me And BlueHatSEO</strong></p> <p><strong>How Did BlueHatSEO Get Started?</strong><br /> I&#8217;ve always been very independent in the SEO world. I&#8217;ve never really read SEO sites, nor am I very active in the SEO community. I viewed the industry like I would a game. I could go find some walkthroughs and ruin all the fun or I could go out and do my own research and testing and defeat it on my own. About a year ago I finally got curious of what others were up to and started becoming a bit more active in the industry. Honestly within a week I was bored to tears. The industry didn&#8217;t seem to have changed a bit since back in the days when self proclaimed gurus were telling everyone the keys to success online were simply to submit their sites to the search engines and post on some Free For All Link sites. So the wacko crackpot in me came out swinging with his crazy jibberish talk. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  It didn&#8217;t really result in anything until one day when I was bitching to a friend about how boring blogs are when he said something along the lines of &#8220;well you talk about some crazy good shit. You should create a blog and show &#8216;em how its done.&#8221; That statement didn&#8217;t really settle in until the next day when I happened to of seen a quote by Muhammad Ghandi on a stamp of all things that said, &#8220;Be the change you want to see in the world.&#8221; I thought about it for a moment, and that was that. I was determined to make some waves in the SEO world. Blue Hat SEO was born. Nothing grand nothing notable, but there it was none the less.<br /> <strong><br /> What&#8217;s With The New Hat Color Con Polluting My Nice Monochrome Universe?</strong><br /> People tell me all the time that &#8220;Blue must be your favorite color.&#8221; Actually blue is my least favorite color. If we&#8217;re going to get personal about it, green is my favorite. Blue is simply a random color picked off the top of my head. Nothing more nothing less. The blue hat represents the idea of Advanced SEO. I really don&#8217;t mean to conpollute the whole white hat, blackhat and gray hat understanding. I just use it to represent the fact that what you read here is so off the wall and different it can&#8217;t be classified properly. Its just simply different.<br /> <strong><br /> Why Am I Doing All This?</strong><br /> I&#8217;m not doing this to be cool or bring any form of fame to myself. I&#8217;m not some kind of lame masked magician dispelling secrets. I don&#8217;t want to be renown and respected in the industry. Infact when all is said and done I should be able to leave back to the SEO shadows just as quietly as I came. I have absolutely no interest in self promotion or the copious amounts of money involved with having the attention of webmasters. I want simply one single thing. Other bloggers to mimic me. If I get my way, and I usually do, in the near future someone wanting to make some money off their webmaster peers won&#8217;t be able to put up some blog, post about boring new google products, and post a picture of themselves with a big check and get anyone to listen. People won&#8217;t be considered experts because they got a couple other experts to vouch for them. They won&#8217;t be able to become popular by doing constant circle jerk interviews(where one person interviews another only so they can be interviewed later by them). There will be only one way to establish yourself as an expert, and that will be to truly know your stuff. I believe this isn&#8217;t as impossible as it sounds. All it takes is one blogger showing two or three others that sharing and actually helping people isn&#8217;t so bad or as scary as it seems. Thats all it takes to create a new standard of quality. The rest in my opinion will spread like cancer on its own. Than before you know it, SEO experts will be judged on what they have to say and the quality of their writings NOT what they claim. I live firmly by the rule that if you can&#8217;t explain something in a way that the average Joe can understand, than you don&#8217;t really understand it all that well yourself. If I fail at everything and accomplish only one thing with this blog I want to <strong>prove</strong> that the viral idea of &#8220;I make too much money to share my techniques&#8221; <strong>IS A LIE!</strong></p> <p><strong>How Far Am I On My Goals?</strong><br /> I&#8217;m nowhere close to where I want it to be but the progress thus far has been nothing short of AMAZING. Don&#8217;t believe me? Check out my blogroll.<br /> Here&#8217;s a few highlights. I know I&#8217;m missing some big ones and for that I&#8217;m sorry. <a target="_blank" href="http://www.earnersblog.com/methods/make-200-dollars-every-day" /></p> <p><a target="_blank" href="http://www.earnersblog.com/methods/make-200-dollars-every-day">How To Make $200/day</a> - I&#8217;m going to go take my Ovaltine cus I just got 0wned with this awesome technique.

Someone, who I&#8217;d like to think was inspired by it, posted back a $200/day technique. The way I see it is, thats a damn good ROI. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Its not a competition its progress and we all win.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.netbusinessblog.com/2007/01/12/domaining-101-researching-keywords"><br /> Domaining 101</a> -  This isn&#8217;t your average &#8220;buy a domain with your keywords in it&#8221; article. Another great thing about this article is that its developed throughout a series. Thats great for both the readers and the writer. For the readers it gives them something to continuously think about and develop on their own. For the writer it forces you to think before you speak. You really have to develop an idea not just post your opinions. I think more bloggers should learn from posts like this.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.monetizetraffic.com/how-to-get-free-content-for-your-blog-set-it-and-forget-it-blogging/2006/12"><br /> How To Get Free Content For Your Blog</a> - A great example of a big change I&#8217;ve been wanting to see in the industry.

Anything else is bullshit.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://helpwebmasters.com/info/domain-kiting-secrets-revealed-my-formula-for-success"><br /> Domain Kiting Secrets Revealed</a> - Also a very well accepted featured repost on Blue Hat for obvious reasons. Its damn good!

Plausible and actually usable ideas. Nothing better, enough said.</p> <p>This is just a few examples of posts and blogs I&#8217;m seeing pop up on the underground all the time. I get about 2-3 emails a week from people wanting to show me their new posts that they are proud of. Its quality like this that the SEO industry has no choice but to bow to. I&#8217;m seeing more and more people all around taking actual pride in their posts and what they share with the community. It&#8217;s a great thing in my opinion and its only going to gain momentum. I&#8217;m feeling lucky button be damned(inside joke).<br /> <strong><br /> Whats In The Future For Blue Hat SEO?</strong><br /> Expect me, and a couple of my friends, to attempt to set some standards in the SEO tools industry. If you search for &#8220;rank checker&#8221; in Google right now there are about 1.3 MILLION results. With all the extremely talented programmers out there I can&#8217;t imagine why the same three or four SEO tool ideas keep getting recycled endlessly. I probably won&#8217;t be the one to change all that, but I at least want to waste the next year of my life proposing the possibility of creating SEO tools that work outside of the conventional box and making them available for public use. Where there&#8217;s a will theres a way.</p> <p>I also plan on fighting hard for every single post to have SOME value to it. Even if the post is just for a laugh I&#8217;ll put forth some effort into inserting something you can use or refer to. I may not be completely successful at this but hey blame the ADD <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>Whats Not In The Future For Blue Hat SEO</strong><br /> I got a few traditions I&#8217;ll continue to stand by firmly in the next year.<br /> <strong>1) No Linkbait -</strong> For as long as this blog stands I will never make a post for the sake of linkbait. To me link bait posts are like cutting all the awesome violence and sex scenes out of a good movie so it can get a PG13 rating and reach a bigger audience.</p> <p><strong>2) No Interviews -</strong> I will never do an interview with someone who isn&#8217;t willing to give out a technique or two. Anything but is nothing more than shameless self and product promotion.  I understand that this rule will more than likely mean no interviews at all, but if thats the way the cookie crumbles, so be it. For me interviews are like masturbation, if others are forced to watch than you might as well put on a show; otherwise keep it to yourself.</p> <p><strong>What Are My Recommended Must-Read Posts For 2006?</strong><br /> <a href="/bluehatseo-technique-3-easy-pr5-1200-1-way-links/">Easy PR5: 1,200 oneway backlinks</a> - This post broke the ground on what I was willing to give away.

However I&#8217;m finding a lack of tact in how to accomplish it successfully. The objective is simple. How do we get a bunch of other people to type in Captchas for us willingly? First we&#8217;ll dive into why this is useful. Lets say you&#8217;re spamming Myspace or Yahoo accounts for instance. You could either attempt to defeat it through various OCR techniques or hire people from India to type them in for you. Captcha decoding is very tough to master and uses loads of server usage. Reliable Indians are tough to find and it poses a margin that you must beat. So now you&#8217;re starting to consider your options. There are still some out there but the best one I can recommend would be to find a way to get others to do it for you by giving them an incentive.</p> <p><strong>What Will You Need</strong><br /> First you will need to create the script that will actually grab the Captcha and output it so you can display it to the user without them knowing what the real reason is of they are typing it in. Next you will need to actually require the user to type it in in order to preform an action on your site. Next your script will need to grab what they type in and check to see if it was correct. Lets say your spamming Myspace. So you display the Captcha on another site of yours and when the user types it in, a second script actually makes the account using what they said the Captcha was. Make sense?</p> <p><strong>The Incentive</strong><br /> I&#8217;ve seen a few ideas mole around about how to do this. Some suggest adding the Captcha to your blog comments. It doesn&#8217;t really do anything and if they don&#8217;t type it in, it will still allow the comment. However anyone who does type it in. The script will create the account and boom your in like flint. However each of these ideas I&#8217;ve heard have one major flaw; lack of traffic. Even if your blog or other site gets 20 comments/day that still isn&#8217;t very many captcha types and hardly worth the trouble. I&#8217;ve also heard some ideas about offering free porn but the problem is still the same wouldn&#8217;t you agree? So you&#8217;ll need a site that will grab major traffic, lots of pageviews, and most of all the users will be obligated to type the traffic.</p> <p><strong>Here&#8217;s My Proposal</strong><br /> Try creating a webproxy. A web proxy is designed to bypass proxy restrictions through a web interface. For example, in a university, the IT department blocks a lot of harmless websites simply because of their popularity. So people use webproxies to access those websites. Creating a webproxy is great because they draw MAJOR traffic and TONS of pageviews very quickly. They don&#8217;t require much promotion to become very popular. They are also very easy to setup. First you&#8217;ll need to find a good webproxy script. I&#8217;d recommend <a target="_blank" href="http://www.jmarshall.com/tools/cgiproxy">CGIProxy</a> or <a target="_blank" href="http://www.phproxy.org/poxy-0.4.zip">PHP Proxy</a>. Use whatever is most comfortable for you to setup and edit. Next you need to do a tad bit of promotion on it. The best way is to sign it up on a few proxy top sites lists or free proxy directories. You&#8217;ll find out quickly that you won&#8217;t need much promotion to get them some serious daily traffic. I recently setup a webproxy (<a target="_blank" href="http://www.myspaceunblock.org">Unblock Myspace</a>) and it was getting 400 unique visitors/day and 20,000 pageviews/day within days of opening with very little promotion. Currently its getting about 700 unique visitors/day and approx <strong>72,000 pageviews/day</strong>. To put that in the math sense; if I display a Captcha for the visitor to type in every 25 random pageviews in order for them to continue to the page they wanted to go to. That comes out to about 2880 Captchas/day. In case you were paying attention thats A LOT of Myspace accounts(money). <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><em>So whats the downside? Well first web proxies are a big strain on servers. A lot of hosting providers don&#8217;t allow them for that reason. An easy way to solve this is to get your own virtual private server/dedicated server, or get a buddy to donate a dedicated box. Another would be to have multiple hosting providers and have the script disperse the traffic amongst them evenly to lighten the load. Where theres a will(money) theres a way. </em> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100121/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100121/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100121/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/creating-an-army-of-free-captcha-typers/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/creating-an-army-of-free-captcha-typers/"     dc:title="Creating An Army of Free Captcha Typers"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100121/http://www.bluehatseo.com/creating-an-army-of-free-captcha-typers/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/creating-an-army-of-free-captcha-typers/#comments" title="Comment on Creating An Army of Free Captcha Typers">136 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/random-thoughts/" title="View all posts in Random Thoughts" rel="category tag">Random Thoughts</a></em>09 Jan 2007 12:05 am</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/parasite-hosting-leads-thanks-to-akismet/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Parasite Hosting Leads Thanks To Akismet"><b>Parasite Hosting Leads Thanks To Akismet</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Whewww! Been busy lately guys! Sorry I haven&#8217;t had much time to get posts out. I&#8217;ve been working with some serious project volume lately. I got a couple posts ready but I&#8217;ve been trying to include some example code and scripts to improve the quality of them. I also got a wicked idea for a Blue Hat Tool. Can it actually top <strong><a href="/quit-quick-indexing-tool/">QUIT</a></strong>?(which has already received tons of mentions for being the only SEO tool on the market that not only gets more spiders to your site faster than any others out there, but for actually boosting rank as well). Big pimpin for a single form submit! What do you think it&#8217;ll be? I&#8217;ll give you a hint, it&#8217;ll be a traffic generator. It&#8217;ll be a bit of time but I promise I&#8217;ll get it all done and out sooner than not. While I&#8217;m rolling on the railroad of excuses I&#8217;m also going to mention that I&#8217;m finally taking some vacation time this month. So I&#8217;ll be out for about 2 net weeks. Yay! So we&#8217;ll see how much I can get your way, but expect some temporary slim pickings this month while I get my shit in gear. In the downtime please keep the awesome <strong><a href="/contribute/">contributions</a></strong> coming! <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>In the mean time I&#8217;ll still be responding to comments and emails as often as I can. Although I got to admit that I&#8217;m addicted to reading the spam comments I&#8217;ve been getting. If you&#8217;re interested in some serious black hat shit give reading your Akismet filter carefully a try. Those pharmaceutical affiliates are downright brilliant at times. In particular I&#8217;ve been watching some of their parasite hosting techniques.</p> <p>One in particular that I&#8217;ve been monitoring closely is doing something that I think is damn cool. From what I&#8217;m gathering he&#8217;s downloading a ton of CMS&#8217; and using directory structures to make a list of identifiable footprints. Then they use Yahoo to find exploitable .EDU sites using these CMS&#8217; for their student homepages. Than (s)he is signing up guest accounts and creating redirecting cloaked doorway pages to pharmaceutical affiliate sites. Then building linkage to those urls through blog spam. I&#8217;m like a kid in a candy store watching these guys send me their URLs to easily exploitable edu parasites. Sure I&#8217;ll take that one! Ooo! that one too! Is that a plone parasite? I&#8217;ll take six! <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>Starting now I&#8217;m going to make a list of my favorite blog spam that passes through here. Not for humor purposes but strictly learning. Than when I got a decent enough sized list I&#8217;m going to post every single one here. Gitty Up!</p> <p><em>If you get any cool ones to your own blogs feel free to <strong><a href="/have-a-question/">email</a></strong> them to me to be added to the list.</em> </p>  	<p
