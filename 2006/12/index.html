Mine was great! I realize I wasn&#8217;t cool like all the other bloggers and wished everyone a Merry Christmas on Christmas day but frankly blogging was the last thing on my mind. Sorry, maybe I&#8217;ll get you all next year. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>Ya know whats fun? If you&#8217;re thinking spamming tech blogs than we should hang out! I also enjoy long walks on the beach and romantic candle-lit dinners. I know tech blog spamming is fun because I have a tendency to do it once in awhile. Sorry guys! The only downside is that tech bloggers tend to be a bit more hardcore about spam then the average Martha Stewart (forget the scandles she can bake awesome pies! So I still love her) . They also are DAMN GOOD at reporting spam. Those little fuckers <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Luckily I have a little solution to getting around it.</p> <p>My solution is probably a bit different than most webmasters because I have a great fiber provider that loves to laugh at spam complaints. Are you paying me big money each month? Than why the fuck should I care about your shitty blog? hehe. I love it! Kudos to the not-my-job award. However I&#8217;ll try to adapt the following tidbits to fit everyone. Particularly those who have shared hosting and VPS&#8217;. I&#8217;ll also cover a fun way on how to spoof your adsense so when they send the complaints to the Adsense team it won&#8217;t do any good. What inspired all this? Honestly it was Jon from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.aojon.com">AOJon.com</a> and <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wickedfire.com">Wickedfire.com</a>. He suggested I should make a &#8220;badass post&#8221; on the Blue Hat. I suggested this technique and he said,&#8230; in a lovingly way, &#8220;Keep this between us it&#8217;ll fuck people already using it if you let the secret out.&#8221; <em><- not a direct quote.</em> However the more I think about it the more I think it&#8217;s better if I do post it. The way I see it is, The percentage of people who will use this technique to stop the narks will increase much greater than the percentage of narks who will use this technique against them. The less effective spam reporting is the better is for me in the long run. So here ya go.</p> <p><strong>First Deal With Your Hosting</strong><br /> Depending on your hosting, sometimes you can point domains to yourself. IE. point to your hosting&#8217;s IP on your primary domain and then all your secondary domains point to ns1.primarydomain.com and ns2.primarydomain.com for the name servers. If this isn&#8217;t the case tell your hosting that you used to run a hosting company and would like to archive your website with them along with your clients. Kind of a move over to their servers if you will. Then make a fake hosting company. Make a nice little website for it and a domain(myawesomehost.com) and be sure to make it unusuable. Perhaps a small disclaimer saying you have shut down and are no longer taking new accounts will suffice. Then put it up on the hosting/vps/whatever. Your hosting company will set in the dns records the nameserver. Then you point that domain to itself using its own ip. If you don&#8217;t know how to do this just check with Godaddy tutorial or ask someone. Its very easy. Then have all your spam sites point to the fake hosting site(the ns1.fakehostingsite.com and ns2.fakehostingsite.com). This will cause the narks to lookup your site in the whois info and grab the hosting information from the nameservers. They will go to the contact form for the fake hosting site of yours and email them a harsh letter saying they should delete your account for spam. You are welcome to collect these emails for future laughs. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Your hosting is never the wiser and still happy because they don&#8217;t have to hear about your complaints.</p> <p><strong>Mask Your Adsense</strong><br /> The next step is to trick the nark into reporting the wrong Adsense account. This could work for just about any CPC program you use. Feel free to post example code in the comments of various others. The first step is to redo all your Adsense banners. Use the &#8220;My Ad Will Appear Within A Frame&#8221; feature in your Adsense setup. This will tell Adsense that your ad will appear within a frame. Put all your Adsense ads on seperate HTML pages and insert them using IFRAMEs within your pages.<br /> Example</p> <pre>&lt;iframe s rc="myads.html" width="460" height="68" border="0"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</pre> <p>Then above each IFRAME insert put in a fake adsense account. Feel free to borrow an adsense sniplet from&#8230;.oh say&#8230;.a competitor!</p> <pre>&lt;script type="text/javascript"&gt;&lt;!-- google_ad_client = "pub-theiradsenseid"; google_ad_width = 728; google_ad_height = 90; google_ad_format = "728x90_as"; google_ad_type = "text_image"; //2006-10-27: channel google_ad_channel = "23402340"; google_color_border = "FFFFFF"; google_color_bg = "FFFFFF"; google_color_link = "0000FF"; google_color_text = "000000"; google_color_url = "E6E6E6"; //-->&lt;/script&gt;  &lt;script type="text/javascript" xsrc="shttp://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js" mce_src="shttp://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js"        &gt; &lt;/script&gt;</pre> <p><strong>Notice how I put the &#8220;s&#8221; infront of the http://pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/show_ads.js ?</strong> Any random character or string will work. This will make the ad not show up and become invisible. This will have a fun effect. The nark will view source on your page. Look for the adsense code. They will see that adsense code and not notice the IFRAME. They will assume that its your code.  They will grab the publisher id and use it to report you to adsense in an attempt to get you banned. You can pretty much use anyones adsense code for this. A competitor might be useful, but I personally enjoy using Digg.com&#8217;s Adsense account because I like to believe the Adsense team gets a chuckle out of getting a complaint about them. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>So there you go! They nark to your host: Your covered! They nark to your advertisers: Your covered! You are now welcome to spam to your hearts content. This isn&#8217;t 100% bulletproof but it will tend to stop a very large percentage of the complaints.<br /> Note that this also works for certain white hat cases where you got some mean competitors trying to oust you. However I wouldn&#8217;t recommend the Adsense portion if thats the case. </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100116/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100116/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100116/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/dealing-with-those-pesky-narks/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/dealing-with-those-pesky-narks/"     dc:title="Dealing With Those Pesky Narks"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/dealing-with-those-pesky-narks/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/dealing-with-those-pesky-narks/#comments" title="Comment on Dealing With Those Pesky Narks">109 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/announcements/" title="View all posts in Announcements" rel="category tag">Announcements</a></em>20 Dec 2006 02:11 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/top-commentators/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Top Commentators"><b>Top Commentators</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Lately I&#8217;ve been priding myself in Blue Hat SEO having the most useful and insightful comments and commentators of any SEO blog I&#8217;ve ever read. For any blogger this is definitely a brag worthy subject. This isn&#8217;t a suck up post it&#8217;s to let everyone know how much I appreciate it. So I feel I have every right to be cocky in this manner and brag for at least one post. This may not be the most popular blog in the sphere but I&#8217;ll be damned if it doesn&#8217;t have the best feedback. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>I was reading some other, more mainstream, SEO blogs this morning and I gotta say just the difference in the insight and intelligence of the readers&#8217; comments are amazing. On other sites they tend to just agree or disagree with a post or blurt out whatever random ass emotion they&#8217;re feeling at the moment. Over here theres a trend of critiquing and research every aspect of the post. People tend to ask the questions everyone else is thinking and what future readers are bound to ask. Then the questions are usually answered intelligently by two or three different people citing their own research and facts. Problems and ambiguities tend to be solved in the same manner. Not to mention; the <a href="/easy-contributions/">reader contributions</a> have been BADASS so far. I gotta say YOU GUYS/GALS KICK ASS!</p> <p>In light of this I just put up a neat plugin I found called <a target="_blank" href="http://www.pfadvice.com/wordpress-plugins/show-top-commentators">Show Top Commentators</a> as a way of thanking the people who comment often. It&#8217;ll post the names of the top 10 global commentators as well as a link to their websites (if applicable) on the navigation. Likewise, this is old news, but I also removed all <a href="/my-external-links/">nofollow links</a> in the comments. So now the people who comment can get properly rewarded with links and the people who comment most can get rewarded even more. Personally I&#8217;d rather do what I can to improve the community here rather than my own faggy Page Rank.</p> <p>I know there are plenty of lurkers still on this site (about 1,600 and growing daily to be exact) that I would love to get commenting on a regular basis. So if you&#8217;re a lurker by all means if you got some questions or insight on a post feel compelled to let us know and help everyone out by leaving a quick comment. Likewise if you&#8217;re not in the habit of reading comments on blogs than I&#8217;d recommend you make an exception here because you&#8217;re missing a ton of great information if you don&#8217;t. The rest of you; You really are making this an awesome place so keep it up because we all appreciate it! I know I&#8217;ve learned a ton from you guys already.</p> <p><strong>Thanks!</strong> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100116/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100116/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100116/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/top-commentators/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/top-commentators/"     dc:title="Top Commentators"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/top-commentators/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/top-commentators/#comments" title="Comment on Top Commentators">190 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/user-contributed/" title="View all posts in User Contributed" rel="category tag">User Contributed</a></em>19 Dec 2006 04:53 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/user-contributed-domain-kiting/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: User Contributed - Domain Kiting"><b>User Contributed - Domain Kiting</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>This one isn&#8217;t so much a contribution as it was me begging to post it. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br /> Its a great article from Phil at <a target="_blank" href="http://www.helpwebmasters.com">HelpWebmasters.com</a> on a technique called Domain Kiting. The original can be found <a target="_blank" href="http://helpwebmasters.com/info/domain-kiting-secrets-revealed-my-formula-for-success">here</a>. He promised he&#8217;ll post more great articles like it so be sure to check out his site in the future.<br /> <strong>Domain Kiting</strong><br /> I’m going to let some secrets out of the bag about Domain Kiting</p> <p>So for those that don’t know what this is, listen up. You can register a domain name and cancel it within 5 days of purchase. It USED to be that the registrars would let you do this for free. Now most registars charge between $0.25 and $2 per canceled domain. See I would register hundreds of domains a week and cancel about 99% of them, just keeping the good ones that got traffic in the 5 day period. I would reg the domains and then change the DNS over to a parking page (like sedo.com) then I would be able to easily see how much direct navigation (type in traffic) I got.</p> <p>Here is the formula for figuring out which domains to keep:</p> <p>1. (Amount of type-ins in 5 days) * (365/5) = amount of traffic you could reasonably expect in a year. Now a good parking page will get ~20% click through rate, so take your clicks per year * 20% = number of clicks that you get paid on.</p> <p>note: keep in mind seasonality…so if you register xmas domains expect to see higher numbers in December.</p> <p>2. Find out the average CPC via the overture tool by taking the top 5 bids and averaging them so this formula is: bid1 + bid2 + bid3 + bid4 +bid5 / 5</p> <p>3. Now take that average bid per click price and divide that by 2. This is the rough amount per click that you can expect from a PPC program on a parking site or Google Adsense, Yahoo Publisher Network, etc…</p> <p>4. Next take the price you paid to reg the domain / average PPC from step 2 =# of clicks you’ll need in a year to break even on your domain.</p> <p>5. So, if the # from step 1 is > # from step 4 then you are in the black.</p> <p>Let me do some real numbers to highlight this again.</p> <p>1. So I got 4 clicks in 5 days during my domain testing period. Take that number times 73 (73 is from 365/5) that that equals 292 clicks per year. Take clicks per year 292 * 20% and you get = ~58</p> <p>2. Now by doing keyword research we find that advertisers are paying $0.34 a click.</p> <p>3. Divide $0.34 by 2 to get your estimated earnings per click at $0.17</p> <p>4. Let’s say I register a domain name for $7.00 per year divide that by $0.17 and you get ~41. So you will need 41 clicks a year to break even on your domain.</p> <p>5. So you estimate that you can get roughly 58 clicks and you break even at 41 clicks. So u in da black.</p> <p>Conclusion:</p> <p>So imagine what happens when you find one that gets a TON of clicks and advertisers are willing to pay BIG $$$ for each click…Booya! Or, think economies of scale, it takes you very little time to register these domains and if you do them by the hundreds or thousands then the profits add up quick.</p> <p>Disclaimer/Pitfalls:</p> <p>Start slow and ease into this. This formula is an estimate only, the variable that will put you in the red are:</p> <p>1. Conversion rate on the parking/landing page: I see ~20% on most of mine, some higher some lower, it all depends on the matching for your keywords. To get a good idea of what this might be look at the ads that appear with your domain keyword, Are they relevant? Would you click on it?<br /> 2. Advertiser CPC, seasonality and advertisers just pulling out will affect how accurately you can predict what they are willing to pay per click.<br /> 3. Your individual cut from the parking program or contextual advertising program, this number will vary as well.</p> <p>Enjoy!</p> <p><strong>Thanks Phil for the great article! </strong> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100116/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100116/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100116/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/user-contributed-domain-kiting/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/user-contributed-domain-kiting/"     dc:title="User Contributed - Domain Kiting"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/user-contributed-domain-kiting/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/user-contributed-domain-kiting/#comments" title="Comment on User Contributed - Domain Kiting">54 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/neat-tricks-and-hacks/" title="View all posts in Neat Tricks and Hacks" rel="category tag">Neat Tricks and Hacks</a></em>17 Dec 2006 08:36 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2"><b>Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Another one? Haha didn&#8217;t see that comin&#8217; did ya! If you haven&#8217;t already; be sure to read one of my favorite posts on <a href="/free-links-freebie-abandoned-wordpress-accounts/">Abandoned Wordpress Accounts</a> before continuing to read this post. Got it? Good! <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p>So by now you&#8217;ve had about 6 months to hopefully grab at least a couple hundred already indexed and quality built Wordpress accounts. Good! You&#8217;ve also probably added links to your sites that could use a good IBL and page rank boost. Great! Your on your way except now we just need to convert these medium quality links into great links. Awesome! Lets get to it.</p> <p><strong>Recovery</strong><br /> First things first, we need to recover some abandoned content and lost links. Lookup your abandoned blogs on Archive.org and see if you can scrounge up some old posts. For some more recent ones you can do a linkdomain: on Yahoo or something. Then pull the cached copy of the individual posts. Repost them on your blogs and try to match the Post Slugs (the url to the post itself ie. myblog.wordpress.com/my-awesome-post). This will ensure that all the old links that exists to the blog and individual posts will still be giving you credit and traffic instead of going to an ugly 404. Also be sure to put up a post about how the blog got abandoned but out of kindness you reposted the old posts for the users&#8217; sake. How kind of you! This will also give the original owner a small opporunity to complain and ask you to take down the posts(don&#8217;t be a jerk do it if asked, no matter how small the chances are they will actually ask or care). This will keep everyone happy and preserve your linking and traffic.</p> <p><strong>Remodeling</strong><br /> A URL is just a URL. However a theme and topic is great link potential. Remodel the site to fit what kind of links you&#8217;re wanting. If your wanting tech news type links change up the keywords to match a technews type content. This&#8217;ll help transform your medium quality links to a semi-relevant stature.</p> <p><strong>Build</strong><br /> Now lets build some more relevant content as well as relevant IBL links to the blogs. This is where it gets interesting. Remember when I said to make a common Wordpress account and attach all your new blogs to the same account? If you didn&#8217;t take that advice you&#8217;re going to wish you did, because now we&#8217;re going to talk about how to get huge amounts of links and content to your blogs. Don&#8217;t worry it&#8217;ll be easy, it&#8217;ll be whitehat, and like the first part of the technique it also can be done completely by hand.</p> <p><strong>1)</strong> Go to Digg.com (Shoutwire also works) and signup with an account.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Go to your account settings and edit your blog settings. Put in your main login and password for your main Wordpress account. Digg will be kind enough to generate a nice list of all your blogs that are attached to that account next time you login. So in the future you can easily switch between them quickly.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Select your first blog and click update.</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> Search for that blogs terms and click &#8220;Blog It&#8221; on all the results. This will do three things. First it will grab the title and the description of the original post and insert it as a new post on your blog. You now got some great content. Secondly, it will post a trackback link on the original post. A percentage of the posts you grab will draw a huge number of backlinks to the original post which ups the quality of your trackback link. It&#8217;ll also drive some traffic(some of my abandoned blogs get over 200 visitors/day for this reason. Lastly this will give you a link on the Digg post itself under &#8220;Who blogged this.&#8221;</p> <p><strong>Lets do the math</strong><br /> You got a couple hundred blogs. Each blog has a couple hundred posts. Each post has at least 2 backlinks. Add the previous inbound links + content. You got yourself hundreds of quality blogs driving traffic and link quality to your real money sites.</p> <p><strong>Life is good</strong> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100116/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100116/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100116/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/"     dc:title="Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/abandoned-wordpress-accounts-pt-2/#comments" title="Comment on Abandoned Wordpress Accounts Pt. 2">107 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/user-contributed/" title="View all posts in User Contributed" rel="category tag">User Contributed</a></em>12 Dec 2006 03:51 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/user-contributed-typos/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: User Contributed- Typos"><b>User Contributed- Typos</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>Here is an experimental <a href="/contribute/">user contributed post</a>.  The reason why I say its experimental is because the post was originally written and sent to me by <strong>George Tucker from <a target="_blank" href="http://www.intelligent-coffee.com">Intelligent Coffee</a>.</strong> It&#8217;s a great article that really got me thinking about what is normally a pretty commonly discussed topic in SEO: typos and misspellings. From there I couldn&#8217;t help myself and had to add my own little ideabox into it. So here are both!<br /> <strong><br /> From George Tucker:</strong><br /> I once enjoyed #1 Google rankings for a misspelling that was <strong>only listed once</strong> on the page, and that was in the META keywords tag.</p> <p>This particular website is a review site for anti-aging and anti-wrinkle skincare products (tons of bucks in that particular niche). I found that there were three different types of keywords that were relatively easy to rank:</p> <p>- Brand names (lots of skin care brands don&#8217;t have a strong online presence)<br /> - Scientific / chemical compound names (N-6 furfuryladenine, anyone?)<br /> - Typos</p> <p>Ranking for typos has become a fairly common concept, but there are three specific methods to generate typos and to make them more effective.</p> <p>1. Do you habitually misspell a word? (For me, it&#8217;s <a href="http://www.intelligent-coffee.com/caffiene">caffiene</a>.) Odds are, others do, too. Use WordTracker to generate a keyword list based on the proper spelling and use find/replace. Congratulations, you&#8217;ve just created your own sub-niche!</p> <p>2. Can&#8217;t remember how to spell something? Take your best guess - then jot down your inadvertent misspelling. (Ridiculous numbers of people are trying to buy <a href="http://www.intelligent-coffee.com/expresso-machines.php">expresso machines</a>.)</p> <p>3. The simple transposition of letters due to typos. When you&#8217;re typing fast and you flub a word, make a note of it. (This is where my formerly-#1 ranking misspelling was born.)</p> <p>To cast a wider net for typos, make use of an automatic typo generator like the <a href="http://frenchfragfactory.net/ozh/typo-trap/index.php">Typo Trap</a>. This particular tool generates typos based on accidentally hitting an adjacent key on a QWERTY keyboard while typing a search term. Because they&#8217;re auto-generated, the words don&#8217;t make much sense, but they&#8217;re good for machine-generated pages and sites. (I find the WordTracker misspelling generator to be completely worthless.)</p> <p>Typos are an excellent example of the long tail, and one that&#8217;s fairly easy to exploit. Often, they&#8217;re low-hanging fruit. Keep track of your own typos and sprinkle them throughout your white hat sites. Generate random typos and plug them into your keyword.txt file for machine-generated sites.</p> <p>&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;&#8212;</p> <p><strong>Great article. Thanks George! I&#8217;ll keep my portion short.</strong></p> <p>As mentioned there are quite a few typo generators available to try such as Typo Trap. However if you&#8217;re an automation junkie like myself and are actually looking for a nice list you should try this&#8230;<br /> 1. Open Microsoft Word on your computer<br /> 2. Click Tools.<br /> 3. Click Autocorrect Options<br /> 4. Look towards the bottom of the dialog box</p> <p>Microsoft was kind enough to provide a nice big list of the most common misspellings and typos in the English language! The downside? No mass select or copy and paste on the list. Yeah bummer right?! Try going to <a target="_blank" href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/207748">http://support.microsoft.com/kb/207748</a> and getting the macro utility. Export your autocorrect db using the macro utility and then see what happens when you open it up in a text editor. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>Outside Resources</strong><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_common_misspellings"><br /> Wikipedia&#8217;s List of Common Mispellings</a> - <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Lists_of_common_misspellings/For_machines">Scrapable version</a>.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:List_of_common_misspellings" /><a target="_blank" href="http://www.yourdictionary.com/library/misspelled.html">Your Dictionary 100 Most Common Mispelled Words</a></p> <p><em><strong>Food For Thought<br /> </strong>How about celebrity names and brand names? </em> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100116/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100116/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100116/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/user-contributed-typos/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/user-contributed-typos/"     dc:title="User Contributed- Typos"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/user-contributed-typos/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/user-contributed-typos/#comments" title="Comment on User Contributed- Typos">83 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/blue-hat-techniques/" title="View all posts in Blue Hat Techniques" rel="category tag">Blue Hat Techniques</a></em>10 Dec 2006 01:46 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/blue-hat-technique-15-mfa-its-all-about-the-homepage/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Blue Hat Technique #15 - MFA: It&#8217;s All About The Homepage"><b>Blue Hat Technique #15 - MFA: It&#8217;s All About The Homepage</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>As many of you might not know I am also a computer tech. I get to help a lot of people with their computer problems and frankly its a lot of fun. It&#8217;s also very educational in the Internet marketing aspect. As experienced Internet users we sometimes loose sight of how the average Internet user behaves. We get so caught up in our own habits of long tailed search phrases and properly quoting terms that we often forget that a worthless searches like the term &#8220;computers&#8221; gets over 200,000 searches/day. I learn more and more every year from the benefits of casually watching friends and family members use the computer. Watching how they browse the Internet, why they click on ads, and how they respond to things like error messages has huge benefits in designing money making campaigns online.</p> <p>This entire technique focuses on just three common user habits that I&#8217;ve noticed over the years with my own clients.</p> <p><strong>1) Double Clicking-</strong> Ever watch your parents or grandparents use the computer? You&#8217;ll probably notice one thing immediately. They double click everything. They double click icons, they double click Internet links, they even double click buttons. Double clicking is the first skill taught when learning how to use the computer, and more often than not, teaching when  double clicking is not required is often skipped. Simply because it typically brings no harm.</p> <p><strong>2) The Homepage-</strong> Homepage changes aren&#8217;t a big deal to the average Internet user. As long as the home page has a search and maybe a bit of useful items like news they simply typically don&#8217;t care about the switch or even bother changing it. Its us experienced Internet users that tend to be hardcore about our homepage. Internet providers realize first hand the power of this trate. Installing a new ISP will change the users homepage to their homepage 90% of the time. I can&#8217;t tell you how many times a client has commented about how much they &#8220;like this new Internet&#8221; when they switch providers and see the new homepage for the first time.</p> <p><strong>3) Decisions-</strong> Dialog boxes and error messages = decisions. Our familiarity to dealing with dialog boxes often makes us forget the power they hold on the typical Internet user. Try this, next time you&#8217;re on the computer with a common user watching and a dialog box comes up and of course you click out of it quickly without needing to read it. Watch the expression they make. It&#8217;s usually something like &#8220;WTF? You didn&#8217;t even read that! What if it was important?&#8221; It&#8217;s funny because its true.</p> <p>The habits definitely don&#8217;t stop with these three. The more you look the more you&#8217;ll find. I just wanted to list some examples of the types of behaviors to look for because the next step is obviously, monetization. So how exactly are we going to use the power of these three habits for our own profit without of course harming the user. The trick is simply; Turn something useless to them into something useful. How about starting with some made for Adsense sites? Then we&#8217;ll take this one step further and turn one user click into reoccurring traffic &#038; Adsense income. The following steps will dive even one step further down the rabbit hole and attempt to increase your click through rates on your MFA(Made for Adsense) sites.</p> <p><strong>The Proccess</strong><br /> <strong>1) Prepare your MFA sites.</strong> MFA sites are great for this technique because they draw the common Internet user and very rarely trick the experienced user. So since your MFA network is already up and drawing a gripload of inexperienced surfers lets begin there.</p> <p><strong>2) Create a nice startpage.</strong> Give it some nice domain like mysmartstartpage.com. Make it pretty and easy to use. Include your Google search box code(through your Adsense account setup) prominently. Then include a bit of news links and possibly a local search. Don&#8217;t forget to put a few inconspicuous ads on the site. Make it look like a really nice start page that you would use yourself if you weren&#8217;t so obsessed with that giant Google logo. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Check out <a target="_blank" href="http://www.charter.net">Charters</a> homepage as a great example. It never hurts to learn from one of the best.<br /> <strong><br /> 3) Insert some homepage change javascript code on your MFA sites.</strong></p> <pre><span id="KonaBody"><tt>document.setHomePage(&#8217;http://www.mywebsite.com&#8217;);</tt></span></pre> <p>I recommend you put it as an onload() in the body tag(see comments). That way it will automatically popup when the page loads.</p> <p><strong>4) Reposition your ads.</strong> The window.position.set properties are held in the registry and are typically never changed on a Windows XP computer. Through practice try to reposition your ad so they are directly underneath where the javascript dialog box will show on a typical 1024&#215;768 or 800&#215;600 resolution computer. Double check your results on several computers for accuracy.</p> <p><strong>What Will This Do?</strong><br /> The user will go to one of your MFA pages and get faced with a small dialog box asking them if they want to change their homepage to your new startpage you built. The experienced user will quickly click cancel and be on their way. No big deal. The rest will click to get rid of the dialog box. A percentage will click OK. This percentage will become your reoccuring income for a long time. Everytime they open their browser they will get your start page. It will be nice so they usually won&#8217;t care. You will get money from the searches they make on your Google adsense search box. You will also get income from the ads placed on the start page. Over a long enough period of time your start page will start to build in its loyal userbase. The more it builds the more reoccuring money it makes.</p> <p><strong>What About The Percentage That Click Cancel?</strong><br /> Remember the first trate of the common Internet user that was mentioned? They click once: it gets rid of the dialog box. They make the second click for the complete double click: you get a click on your Adsense ad. Your CTR on your MFA page just went up! *Insert evil grin*</p> <p><strong>You never really loose.</strong></p> <p><strong>Don&#8217;t Forget To Brand Your New Start Page</strong><br /> Another smart tactic to use would be to brand your new start page. Make it prominent but not in the users&#8217; way. This is important because as the user gets more familiar with the Internet and starts to really learn the ins and outs they will start to become loyal to what they are used to. Since they are in the process of getting used to your start page when it gets changed in the future when they are smart they will remember it and will be more apt to change it back to yours. This creates a long term win for you. </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130529100116/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130529100116/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130529100116/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/blue-hat-technique-15-mfa-its-all-about-the-homepage/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/blue-hat-technique-15-mfa-its-all-about-the-homepage/"     dc:title="Blue Hat Technique #15 - MFA: It&#8217;s All About The Homepage"     trackback:ping="/web/20130529100116/http://www.bluehatseo.com/blue-hat-technique-15-mfa-its-all-about-the-homepage/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/blue-hat-technique-15-mfa-its-all-about-the-homepage/#comments" title="Comment on Blue Hat Technique #15 - MFA: It&#8217;s All About The Homepage">108 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/user-contributed/" title="View all posts in User Contributed" rel="category tag">User Contributed</a></em>03 Dec 2006 04:43 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/how-to-get-a-link-in-wikipedia-my-post-on-syndk8net/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: User Contributed-How To Get A Link In Wikipedia (my post on syndk8.net)"><b>User Contributed-How To Get A Link In Wikipedia (my post on syndk8.net)</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p><strong>User Contributed: Rose Water<br /> </strong><br /> <hr width="400" size="2" /> Sheesh, he posted two brilliant articles on this subject.<br /> When adding links to the articles listed on &#8220;what links here&#8221;, as eli at bluehatseo recommended, if you add your link to the first listed articles they will probably be deleted, because the &#8220;what links here&#8221; widget lists the most popular or most edited articles first or some sort of popularity metric. To spell it out for you guys, add your link to the bottom-most non-talk-page articles first. Even if that article isn&#8217;t closely-related to your niche, it is usually tangientially-related. Then go up the list adding another link on another day.Also, I&#8217;ve found my precise phrase (eg: &#8220;quoted phrase&#8221;) on wikipedia in a completely unrelated article, and changed that phrase in the article into a link to my site, and no one has noticed for a month.
