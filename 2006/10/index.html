Your brain no longer functions. You can&#8217;t seem to accomplish the easiest of tasks without a ton of problems thrown in your face. Ever just completely hit a road block? Yet you find yourself with no option but to just trudge through it for another two or three months and hope you&#8217;ll find some time to just take a break or a short vacation. What happens when those two or three months pass right by you and you swear you&#8217;ll find your break in August or something? Then suddenly it&#8217;s November and you&#8217;re realizing you haven&#8217;t had even a hint of a vacation or any time off in over 3 years. You&#8217;ve been post poning and swearing to your haggard brain that it will eventually get a rest and now your wondering if it will ever actually happen.<br /> You see all your friends, with their &#8220;real&#8221; jobs and their steady biweekly paper checks, lapping you year after year with their vacations; always complaining about how they go by too fast. You just can&#8217;t help but think to yourself&#8230;..fuck the week my years goes by too fast. I couldn&#8217;t imagine how fast a week vacation would go by for me. At this point there would be no advantage to me taking a vacation. I&#8217;d blink and end up missing it.

I affectionately call this technique the Chumbawumba method because <em>when my links get knocked down I put them back up again. Never gonna keep them down. </em>Don&#8217;t pretend like you don&#8217;t know the song. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  This more aggressive method is not only great for keeping your Wikipedia links up but works just as well for many other sites. I would love to hear some brain storms in the comments for other sites that this would work for as well. There are more than you would imagine. Off the top of my head I can think of six.<br /> <strong><br /> Methodology</strong><br /> This process will be ran from a timed cronjob (schedule server task) and will  aggressively ensure that your links stick and stay on all your Wikipedia submissions. This technique will, once again, require knowledge of some form of server side language and will assume you have already finished and have a working version of <a href="/wikipedia-links-pt-2-the-semi-automated-white-hat-way/">Wikipedia Links Pt. 2</a>. I will also assume you have been keeping a database record of all the Wikipages you have submitted to.<br /> <strong><br /> The Process</strong><br /> <strong>1.</strong> Write a script that pulls (LWP) all the edit pages that you have submitted your article links to. Parse out the actual article, the EXTERNAL LINKS, and everything below the external links.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Check the EXTERNAL LINK for your domain. This is easily accomplished through a simple regex command =~ /$domain/.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> If your link exists than ignore the page and move on. If it&#8217;s gone then just readd it. Someone mentioned in the previous posts&#8217; comments that they are in a link war with some of their competitors on Wiki. Their competitors are removing their links and adding their own and visa versa. I could not imagine a worse waste of time. Plus the links disappearing and reappearing does no one any good if neither one can&#8217;t get any trusted link age on the pages. I suggest just stomping them out for good by also parsing for their links and just automatically removing them as they appear. They will eventually tire of fighting your automated system and bow down to the king. I know this sounds mean and unfair but fuck &#8216;em if that&#8217;s the way they are going to be.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> When the script submits back to Wiki be sure to use a solid and tested <a href="/what-is-a-proxy-server/">proxy</a>. That way you can protect yourself from being banned. I&#8217;ve never heard of Wikipedia banning domains from the external links but I suppose it is possible. In which case if this happens just buy a second domain and do a 301 path to direct path redirect to your real domain. No big deal problem solved.</p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Set the script on a cronjob. I recommend setting it for once every 48 hours starting out. Then keep a log of all the times your script has to actually make a change. This will give you a good way to gauge the link loss. Then just adjust the timing accordingly. If you find your links never getting removed than go ahead and just set the cron to run once a week or so. If you got some competitors than set it to every 24 hours during nonpeak hours.</p> <p><em>Dun dun dun dun&#8230;can&#8217;t touch this! Btw today is national gay song day. So don&#8217;t mind me.

So I think this would be a great time for me to fuck up that pretty little proxy planet you&#8217;re on and teach you how to exploit spammers using proxies to your own little spammy or even nonspammy purposes.</p> <p><strong>Cruel Intentions</strong><br /> The intent behind this post will be to teach you how to use massive amounts of trusting spammers to help do your own little spam.  Every good spammer knows public proxies are real hit and miss. Some work many don&#8217;t. Yours will work, it&#8217;ll just accomplish your work not the spammers. I&#8217;m going to assume that you&#8217;ve already done your research and know about public proxies. I&#8217;m also going to assume that you are well aware of the many <a target="_blank" href="http://www.publicproxyservers.com">public proxy lists</a> out there. Every good web spammer has a huge solid list of proxies, and we&#8217;re just going to fuck it up for the rest of them. Sound like fun? Good it will be. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>First Things First</strong><br /> <strong> 1.</strong> Create yourself a public proxy. There are tons of proxy software out there.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.youngzsoft.net/ccproxy/proxy-server-download.htm">CC Proxy is a good Windows based one.</a><br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://osdir.com/Downloads+index-req-viewsdownload-sid-130.phtml">A few open source proxy server software</a><br /> There are also TONS of good ones for linux. I recommend using linux if you are able to do so. Just feel free to do a bit of research on this step before you take the plunge.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Make the proxy server open. This means don&#8217;t make it anonymous. Anonymous proxy server means your IP shows up for every request. Make it so their ip directly makes the pull on every request. This is perfectly acceptable. Most spammers don&#8217;t bother filtering their lists for ones that claim to be anonymous yet aren&#8217;t. They just slam and clean the list from failures.</p> <p><strong>3.</strong> Block EVERYTHING with your proxy server. You can easily block sites and domains with your new kick ass proxy server. You may also set what default site they are redirected to everytime they make a request through your server and have it result in a successful pull. So just block everything and focus on the page all their requests will return with. I will call this page your &#8220;return blocked page&#8221; because many proxy servers have different terms for it. Wanna see an example? Try using proxy 205.221.223.1 on port 80. It&#8217;ll result in every site you go to returning with <a target="_blank" href="http://www.cal.k12.ia.us">CAL Community School District</a> website.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Build your return blocked page. This page will be your weapon. Whatever you would normally do through a proxy can be accomplished or even redirected through this page. Want to slam an advertisers form? Want to post to guestbooks or blogs? How about just slamming a referrer list or even having them post a fake post on your forum? Whatever and however you want! The world is yours. Their IP accomplishes the task. No worries about cpu usage or failed proxy connections. The spammers ip and scripts does all the work. Your server just sends the redirect. Since you will eventually have hundreds to thousands of spammer using your server the page pulls will seem natural and randomly timed. Aside from the absolute huge amounts of them of course. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /><br /> <em><br /> If creativity isn&#8217;t your strong suite and you can&#8217;t think of a good way to utilize this step just settle with using it to raise your Alexa rank or even have it search for your terms in one IFrame with Yahoo or something then have it click on your link in another iframe. This should help Yahoo see your site as getting a higher CTR on your search terms. That got you grinning didn&#8217;t it? How about having it bookmark your site in social bookmark sites for quick indexing? *waves to SEOStomp*<br /> </em></p> <p><strong>5.</strong> Submit your awesome new &#8220;anonymous&#8221; public proxy server to some repositories. This will get it some normally unwanted attention and give it a little bit of time to spread  around like cancer. Just remember to advertise it as a anonymous server. Most won&#8217;t ever double check that. Infact their scripts will report back a successful pull everytime on your server. It won&#8217;t be until they actually check the content that they will stand a chance of figuring removing your server from their list.<br /> <a target="_blank" href="http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&amp;q=public+proxy+servers&amp;btnG=Google+Search">Here&#8217;s a few hundred to start out on.</a></p> <p>There ya go. I could spend the next 100 pages giving you ideas on what to do with your now ultimate proxy server. By ultimate proxy server i didn&#8217;t mean your actual server i meant the chumps using your server and their virgin ip addresses. Just remember, no one EVER manually goes through their proxy lists and checks for these things. They may check the returned content to see if its what they expected to get, but if it doesn&#8217;t chances are they won&#8217;t sit there and manually pull it and find out what your doing. However if you are paranoid about them knowing about the technique your using then feel free to be a little sneaky about your redirect or frames.</p> <p><em>If you are a complete white hat and just want to have a little fun. Feel free to boost your friends population on their forums and such by having every single spammer you catch inadvertantly signup <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' />  Hell, I won&#8217;t condone it but it would be pretty funny to have them automatically email their ISP with the what they are trying to do.

At the moment Blue Hat SEO is the only site on the internet dedicated to the art of advanced SEO. However I have gotten lonely of writing to advanced audiences and would like to start drawing the attention of beginnner SEOs. So instead of teaching advanced ways of manipulating proxy servers I&#8217;m just going to explain what they are in plain english. So from now on please expect these kinds of newbie posts on Blue Hat SEO because that is all you are going to get. Sorry, but I wouldn&#8217;t of had to do this if more people had clicked on that big donate button.<br /> <strong><br /> Definition of a proxy server</strong>-<font size="-1">A server that acts as an intermediary between a workstation user and the Internet so that the enterprise can ensure security, administrative control, and caching service. A proxy server is associated with or part of a gateway server that separates the enterprise network from the outside network and a firewall server that protects the enterprise network from outside intrusion.</font></p> <p>Basically a proxy server is a computer someone sets up that works as a middleman between you and other websites. In other words when you go to a website, first your computer goes to the proxy server and says hey I want to go to www.google.com. Then the proxy server goes to google.com and downloads the page. The proxy server then sends the page to you. So in a sense you download only from the proxy server and the proxy server downloads what you ask.</p> <p>This has several benefits. Security is the biggest. Large corporate networks can track and watch what everyone in the network is going to. It provides a great deal of control because the proxy server can first retrieve the page and easily block it, should the need arise. Blocking other web addresses on a proxy server is easy. The other benefit comes from &#8220;anonymous proxies.&#8221; This popular form of proxy never passes your ip address. Intead it uses the ip address of the proxy server. So people don&#8217;t know who you are.</p> <p><strong>How Are Proxy Servers Useful To Web Spammers?</strong><br /> There are some great sites on the Internet that allow you to download large lists of public proxy servers. These are servers that allows anyone to connect to them and use them. This creates a huge advantage because then you can fake it so it looks like you have TONS of different IP addresses. It makes you much less traceable when you are spamming. It also allows you to look like you are different users. So the places you are spamming and link bombing can&#8217;t identify a single person making all these accounts or posts on their site.</p> <p>Since I plagiarized this post a bit here are some sites that have some more information on Proxy Servers. If you aren&#8217;t familiar with them definitely do some research and find out as much as you can. They are a very useful thing to know about.</p> <ul> <li><a target="_blank" href="http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/P/proxy_server.html"> What Is A Proxy Server</a>-Wediopedia</li> <li><a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proxy_server">Proxy Servers</a>-Wikipedia</li> <li><a target="_blank" href="http://tldp.org/HOWTO/Firewall-HOWTO.html">Firewall and Proxy Server HOWTO</a>-TLDP</li> </ul> <p>So I know a few of you just read this whole thing and are like What the fuck! Wow, Eli really did sell out didn&#8217;t he?  I know I know, writing a little tutorial on what a proxy server is definitely is not advanced and for most experienced SEOs it should even be common knowledge. Perhaps there is something else going on here. Maybe I just wrote this because I got a new post coming out that&#8217;s going to knock your proxy loving world on its ass and I just had to get this information out of the way and into a reference mark so it wouldn&#8217;t pollute the real information with beginner stuff. There may even be a little something for the white hats in the possible upcoming post, or perhaps I really did just sell out <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><em>PS.

Not a lot of people properly understood the concept of autoresponder marketing and so it naturally fell into the pits of spam and pyramid schemes. Fuckin amateurs. However to this day they are extremely useful if used right and tactfully. The few that truly understand how to use them are now rich because of it. So instead of delving into the old ways and telling you to go create a ton of ffa link sites and directories then spam the submitters&#8217; fake email addresses with MLM programs I&#8217;m going to show you how to quickly and easily make an effective autoresponder network that&#8217;ll actually create you sales and leads so fast it&#8217;ll make your bowels spin. It also may make you a ton of friends along the way.</p> <p><strong>How Does A Proper Autoresponder Work?</strong><br /> The autoresponder we&#8217;re aiming for will produce a site which the webmasters in a niche will WANT a link on. It will stay clear of the directory and link farm radar and will have no place in submitter programs. It will naturally be found by webmasters who are deeply hunting for places to put in their link. It will only allow a few links and look very nonspammy. It will also require the webmaster to put in their email address in order to submit their link. The webmaster will see no reason why not to put in thier real email address. You will then merge that mailing list to create a powerful marketing network to advertise your products to webmasters and website owners in your niche.</p> <p><strong>How Does A Autoresponder Make Money?</strong><br /> You will either sell your REAL site or service to them. Whether that be convincing them to advertise on your site for a low monthly or CPC fee, or sell them an actual product. It will also allow you do a bit of affilliate marketing. You can either find a directory that will pay you for every person you get to submit to their paid directory or hell&#8230;create your own! It also doesn&#8217;t hurt to dabble in selling some website promotion software through affilliate links. The possibilities are endless. All else fails help your friends out in exchange for promoting your other sites. <em>&#8220;I&#8217;ll advertise your website to my mailing list if you&#8217;ll give me a couple links on your sites.&#8221;</em></p> <p><strong>How To Create An Autoresponder Network The Right Way</strong><br /> The easiest way to explain this is through an example. Then just modify it for whatever niche your wanting. Lets pretend you want to target real estate agents and the infinite supply of local real estate webmasters.</p> <p><strong>1.</strong> Create a Real Estate BIO site for each state. Hell go each county if the budget will permit you. Grab some easy content like state facts(census information, flag, exports, home information, market stats, biggest cities) and put it up. Gain a few links to it and make it look very nice.</p> <p><strong>2.</strong> Have a small section down at the bottom or something where it says &#8220;Useful Kansas Real Estate Sites&#8221; or whatever fits your topic. Then allow them to submit their link for &#8220;review&#8221; to be added to the list. This will also require their email address.<br /> <em>I&#8217;ve seen a few sneaky places that do this tell you to email them with your link if you want it included. Then they just have a script parse the email address and link from the fake email address and add it to your list.</p> <p></em><strong>3.</strong> Mass produce them like crazy. You can even put adsense or something up on them to help them cover their intial costs on their own. Generate a few links to them and let them roll into the engines. Most of the time you&#8217;ll get stomped by other big info sites in the organics for people actually looking for the information, but the people actually looking to promote their sites will easily find you. It also doesn&#8217;t hurt to require them to link back to you on their site before you include their link.</p> <p><strong>4.</strong> Limit the links via a roll. Have the sites allow ~10 sites. Then when a new one comes in let the oldest roll out of the list. By that time the webmaster that submitted the link will have forgotten all about it anyways. Then you might even have yourself a one way link <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><strong>Starting the Advertising</strong><br /> You can always go the blatant route on the advertising. Let them know somewhere down the road they opted into a mailing list. You can otherwise be subtle about it and act like you are personally contacting them saying, &#8220;Hey thanks for adding your link. I really liked your site, btw here&#8217;s what else I got that you might find useful&#8230;&#8221; Eitherway you got them right where you want them and it should be easy to milk some money from the now huge growing list. Either way lots of money is to be made from this if you do it right.</p> <p><em>If you&#8217;re not into the money part but would rather startup a large ringtones forum or something, remember this method may just help you get the userbase off the ground so fast it&#8217;ll have NASA shitting their pants and yelling at the bus driver to pull over. So have fun with it <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em> </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130519032103/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130519032103/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130519032103/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/how-to-create-your-own-autoresponder-network/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/how-to-create-your-own-autoresponder-network/"     dc:title="How To Create Your Own Autoresponder Network"     trackback:ping="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/how-to-create-your-own-autoresponder-network/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/how-to-create-your-own-autoresponder-network/#comments" title="Comment on How To Create Your Own Autoresponder Network">98 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/announcements/" title="View all posts in Announcements" rel="category tag">Announcements</a></em>10 Oct 2006 07:51 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/new-contact-e-mail/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: New Contact E-Mail"><b>New Contact E-Mail</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>I finally got off my lazy ass and made an email account on the BlueHatSEO domain.

This post will detail a bit more advanced way to gain links from Wikipedia and takes a step forward in the complicated sector. So if you&#8217;re not ready for it please get ready before attempting. It will also require knowledge of coding so don&#8217;t let that take you by surprise.</p> <p><strong>The Objective</strong><br /> The objective of this technique will be to semi-automate the process of submitting your content links to <a target="_blank" href="http://www.wikipedia.org">Wikipedia</a>. There will be two backends. The first will be used by your content writers(you if applicable). The second will be the actual process of submitting your links. Also note that when I use the term content writers, I am referring to you or anyone else that writes the content for your site.<br /> <strong>The Process</strong><br /> <strong>1)</strong> Create a subsection on your domain where your content writers can post their articles. Create this much like the first part of this series specifies. Make a backend for the content writers to post the articles so they don&#8217;t have to do it manually or through the CMS. It also helps to put in a good WYSIWYG editor for their benefit. The form for the article will need to include the category the article should be placed in(a category editor is a nice addition), the title of the article, the article itself, and 6-10 keyword boxes.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> After the content writers have written the article and filled out the form and clicked the nice big submit button you will need to further code the next page. Through the script have the next page pull the en.wikipedia search for each one of the keywords specified. Parse and list the results with check boxes next to them. That way the content writer has the option of checking all the places on wikipedia they would like the article they just wrote to be submitted to. It wouldn&#8217;t hurt to write some limits on this portion to keep it simple and the spamminess of it down. Limit the keywords they can use to describe their article and limit the results it&#8217;ll provide from the search.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> After they have selected the Wikis they want to link to the article they press the final submit button. This will then publish the article on your website. Then it will LWP the wiki edit page which will be formatted something like http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Title_Of_Wiki_Article&#038;action=edit<br /> The easiest way is to just grab the title of the article, remove any redundant phrases like &#8220;Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia&#8221; and syntax replace spaces with underscores. Pull the article source and regex for ==External links==. Below the external links insert<br /> * [http://www.mydomain.com/pathtoarticle Article Title] -Could also put in a short 100 char description here if wanted.</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> Then you just have to post the form, and double check the article for the change. Always! be sure to double check, because if your script messes up the Wiki article that means big trouble. So definitely test before you play, and every time you double check make sure you save the old original copy so if it makes a big mistake you can easily and quickly put the old article back in and find where your mistake was. Also be sure to check for a few human errors that may mess up the posting to Wiki. For instance make sure they can&#8217;t put *&#8217;s or ]&#8217;s in the title or html for that matter. That&#8217;ll cause some major problems with the Wikipedia insert.</p> <p>Well there you go. I know this is rough but its the best I can do short of posting the actual code (my answer is no for those about to ask). Just use it wisely and test test test before you actually use in mass. This is a semi automated method and is very fast and easy. If you are an idiot and amateurish about it you&#8217;ll ruin it for EVERYONE very quickly. All in all this is a great way to automate the aspects of your promotion work and the work of the content writers for your site. Over time once the content writers get the hang of it, it creates a great way to get a ton of high PR links. Once created and in practice it will shock you on how fast the empire builds using this method. Just remember what I said be responsible with it, not every article you write should be submitted to every search result. Being discrete is the key to success here. </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130519032103/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130519032103/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130519032103/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/wikipedia-links-pt-2-the-semi-automated-white-hat-way/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/wikipedia-links-pt-2-the-semi-automated-white-hat-way/"     dc:title="Wikipedia Links pt 2 - The Semi-Automated White Hat Way"     trackback:ping="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/wikipedia-links-pt-2-the-semi-automated-white-hat-way/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/wikipedia-links-pt-2-the-semi-automated-white-hat-way/#comments" title="Comment on Wikipedia Links pt 2 - The Semi-Automated White Hat Way">102 Comments &#187;</a></div>						 			<div class="post-title"><em><a href="/category/general-articles/" title="View all posts in General Articles" rel="category tag">General Articles</a></em>07 Oct 2006 08:20 pm</div> <p class="post-info"><a href="/float-like-a-porn-site-sting-like-a-membership-site/" rel="bookmark" title="Permanent Link: Float Like A Porn Site Sting Like A Sales Page"><b>Float Like A Porn Site Sting Like A Sales Page</b></a></p> <div class="post-content" align="justified"> 	<p>With all the new trends hitting the Internet every year I just can&#8217;t help but sit back and laugh at the broad scope of things. The public is amazed at the changes happening in the background but completely miss the pattern that we webmasters all knew back when we were horny teenagers first learning web design.</p> <p><strong>The porn industry sets the standards for the Internet.</strong></p> <p>Everyone knows it but yet they don&#8217;t catch on until about 2 years after the porn sites have already made it a standard. Facts be faced and the &#8220;master promoters of today&#8221; be damned; the adult industry  has us all beat by a mile. Since the beginning they have specialized in grabbing attention, converting the user, and keeping the audience. We nonadult webmasters with our content sites, spam sites, or whatever haven&#8217;t even begun to catch up with them and in my opinion find ourselves about 2 years behind. Web 2.0? Don&#8217;t make me laugh. Take almost any porn site from 2003-2004ish and look at how they are designed. They didn&#8217;t call it anything amazing they just did what tested to convert best. Once again, in my humble opinion, I don&#8217;t think for a moment that we are being revolutionary. Some may disagree with me here but for what it&#8217;s worth there is a lot that can be learned from modern porn sites. A large majority of which is held in the way they design and promote. Since I&#8217;m not an adult webmaster(sorry but the money isn&#8217;t worth desensitizing my love of real life boobs) I&#8217;ll focus this post on the promoting aspect.</p> <p>So what trends do you see in the porn industry right now? How do you see them promoting their sites outside of the seach engines? Well there&#8217;s tons at the moment but one of the biggest I&#8217;m seeing is how they handle affiliates. They take their membership based sites and put in previews and tidbits of content to get the users to convert. They then take almost ALL the content they have in the members area and hand it out like candy to their affiliates. The affiliates no longer have to trick the users into going to the links, they just post up the content everywhere they can. I&#8217;m not just talking about member based advertisers I&#8217;m also talking about products and anything else.</p> <p><strong>Affiliates</strong><br /> Lets say you sell car audio. Just following this model, why not hand out free full version software to your affiliates that will help their users tune their own car stereos to the maximum? Why not have videos of your sponsored competition cars kicking ass and hand it out to all your affilliates? Give them full pages of interactive content with statements like &#8220;Thank you -link- audio for providing the useful video on how to increase the throw and pitch on stock speakers.&#8221; There are a million ideas and twists that can be done to this concept that the adult industry has mastered and tested for years now. Their wisdom and testing has already proven the inevitable drop in link and sales pitch tactics. So we might as well drop them now and stay one step ahead. If we know where the trends are going why not follow them before the rest of the competition does?</p> <p><strong>Ad Formats</strong><br /> Also notice how the adult industry is formatting their ads on other sites. It&#8217;s moved away from &#8220;Hey don&#8217;t you want to see Pamela Anderson naked&#8221; to &#8220;Check out this chick with triple D&#8217;s trying to play socker naked.&#8221; The user naturally goes &#8220;I gotta see this!&#8221; The move to &#8220;shocking ads&#8221; from &#8220;here&#8217;s what i got&#8221; ads isn&#8217;t a surprising one. The shocking ads will get the user digging. If they click on the link and don&#8217;t see the content they were wanting they will click around in a determined fashion on your site till they find it. Lets say you sell home theater equipment. &#8220;Check out this $150,000 home theater system I setup in my home!&#8221; Holy crap i gotta see this, i bet its badass! They click and see all the images and read stuff about &#8220;It features a -link- Philips TSU3000 -/link- universal touch screen  remote with a high end -link- Hitachi CP-X345 Projector -/link-. Boom you got yourself some &#8220;I gotta have that&#8221; sales.</p> <p>Well I can take this article on for at least another 4-5 pages but I&#8217;m going to stop it here now that I got a few brain gears turning. The lesson here is, just watch for the trend setters. Beat the rest of your industry to it. Black hatters, are you wanting to know what to do next to push your cpc and affilliate sites? Just look at how its already being done successfully in the adult industry. You can learn a lot from their mistakes and successes. </p>  	<p class="post-info"> 													 	</p> 	<!-- 		<rdf:RDF xmlns:rdf="/web/20130519032103/http://www.w3.org/1999/02/22-rdf-syntax-ns#" 	    xmlns:dc="/web/20130519032103/http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/" 	    xmlns:trackback="/web/20130519032103/http://madskills.com/public/xml/rss/module/trackback/"> 		<rdf:Description rdf:about="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/float-like-a-porn-site-sting-like-a-membership-site/"     dc:identifier="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/float-like-a-porn-site-sting-like-a-membership-site/"     dc:title="Float Like A Porn Site Sting Like A Sales Page"     trackback:ping="/web/20130519032103/http://www.bluehatseo.com/float-like-a-porn-site-sting-like-a-membership-site/trackback/" /> </rdf:RDF>	--> </div> <div class="post-footer"><a href="/float-like-a-porn-site-sting-like-a-membership-site/#comments" title="Comment on Float Like A Porn Site Sting Like A Sales Page">80 Comments &#187;</a></div>				<p align="center"> &#8212;
