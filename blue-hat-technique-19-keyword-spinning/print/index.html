It&#8217;s been awhile since I&#8217;ve sat down and written a [1] <a href="/category/blue-hat-techniques/" rel="external">Blue Hat Technique</a>. It just so happens I need this one for the next SEO Empire post. I&#8217;m like blah blah talking about Keyword Spinning then I realized you guys have no fuckin&#8217; clue what I&#8217;m yammering about. So I figure nows a good time to fix all that and luckily this one is really really easy but like all Blue Hat Techniques it works like a mofo in many situations.</p> <p><strong>The Problem</strong><br /> Let&#8217;s say you have a database driven website. A great example would be a [2] <a href="/power-indexing-tips/" rel="external">joint page</a> has its keywords such as &#8220;17 Inch Water Pipes For Sale&#8221; and the page titles and headers match accordingly. You have several thousand pages/products put together and are well SEO&#8217;d but its impossible to monitor and manually tweak each one especially since most of the keyword research tools available aren&#8217;t entirely accurate to the keyword order. Like they may say &#8220;Myspace Pimps&#8221; gets 50 billion searches a day when really &#8220;Pimps On Myspace&#8221; are getting it. So while amongst your thousands of pages you have one page that could be ranking for a solid phrase and getting an extra 100 visitors/day for people searching for &#8220;Water Pipes For Sale 17 Inch&#8221; you&#8217;re stuck with virtually no search traffic to that page and never knowing the difference. It&#8217;s quite the dilemma and you probably realize that it&#8217;s more than likely already happening to you. Luckily its easily fixed with a simple tool you can create yourself to fit whatever needs and sites you have.</p> <p><strong>Methodology</strong><br /> <strong>1)</strong> Add an extra field to all you&#8217;re database entries. Any row that creates a page of some sort add an extra field called TrafficCount or something you can remember.</p> <p><strong>2)</strong> Add a snippet of code into your template or CMS that counts each pageview coming from a Goohoomsn referrer and increments the appropriate field.</p> <p><strong>3)</strong> Wait a month&#8230;.*Goes for a bike ride*</p> <p><strong>4)</strong> Call the titles in the database. It can only be assumed, even in a commercial/free CMS that the titles or keywords are held somewhere in the database. Locate them and scan through them one by one.</p> <p><strong>5)</strong> Use the Google/Yahoo/MSN API&#8217;s to see if the page ranks for its keywords.</p> <p><strong>6)</strong> If it does rank than compare that to the traffic count for the month. Compare that to some sort of delimiter you&#8217;ve preset. I prefer to use a really small number like 5 for the first month or two then start moving it up as needed. If the traffic is too low than split the titles/keywords and randomly reorganize them.</p> <p><strong>*</strong><em>Sometimes you&#8217;ll end up with some really messed up titles like &#8220;Pipes Sale Water For Inch 17&#8243; so if its too un-userfriendly than you may want to make a few adjustments such as never putting a For,The,If,At type word in the front or never rearranging the front two words so like Water Pipes always stays in the front then only the trailing ends. Once again it depends on how your site is already organized.</em></p> <p><strong>7)</strong> Reset the traffic count.</p> <p><strong>8)</strong> Wait another month and watch your search traffic slowly rise. Every month the site will get more and more efficient and get more and more deep traffic to the site. The pages that are already good will not change and the poor performing pages will start becoming higher performing pages. As an added bonus it will help improve your sites [3] <a href="/blue-hat-technique-13-maintaining-your-rank-by-manipulating-freshness-factors/" rel="external">freshness factors</a>.</p> <p><strong>9)</strong> Take a scan of your average number of keywords or title sizes. Let&#8217;s say your average page has very short key phrases such as &#8220;Large Beer Mugs.&#8221; There are only so many combinations that those keywords will produce so if its just a low traffic keyword theres no point in continually changing the titles every single month forever. So I like to only have the Keyword Spinning script run for a preset amount of months on each site. For instance if my average keyword length is three words than the most combinations I can have is six. So I should logically quit running after 6-8 months. At which point my site is about as perfect as it can be without human intervention. Lastly don&#8217;t forget to [4] <a href="/blue-hat-technique-12-improving-ctr-in-organic-results/" rel="external">make improvements to your CTR</a>.</p> <p>Simple huh! Keyword Spinning is a really easy way to get the most out of nearly all your sites. The more you can squeeze out of each site the less sites you have to build to reach your profit goals. With minimal scripting its all very quick to implement and automate (please don&#8217;t do it by hand!). That&#8217;s all there is to it. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> <p><em>Usually with my Blue Hat Techniques I like to drop a little hint somewhere in it that references a really cool trick or spin to the method that&#8217;ll greatly increase your profits. Since You&#8217;ve been all so damn patient about me being late on the SEO Empire part 2 post, and for the moment at least, quit asking me why Blue Hat sucks now I&#8217;ll just tell it to ya. My answer to that question BTW is that I&#8217;m still working on my projects which is eating up some time and I&#8217;m not happy with what I&#8217;ve written so far. If I&#8217;m not happy, it doesn&#8217;t get published. Sorry but the boss has spoken. <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':)' class='wp-smiley' /> </em></p> <p><strong>The Secret Hint</strong></p> <blockquote><p>3) Wait a month&#8230;.*Goes for a <strong>bike ride</strong>*</p></blockquote> <p>Use this technique on your [5] <a href="/seo-empire-part-1/" rel="external">Cycle Sites</a> that you&#8217;ve choosen to not cycle out. Instead of competing with the original author, who you are probably linking to might I add, you can sometimes grab even better phrases and rank for them giving you a ton more traffic (I&#8217;ve seen Cycle Sites increase their SE traffic over 50x by doing this). If not than you&#8217;ll eventually get their original title again which at least will put you where you started. It&#8217;s also the strangest damn thing, you&#8217;ll get a percentage less complaints and pissed off bloggers when you switch the titles around, maybe they don&#8217;t care as much when they don&#8217;t see you ranking for their post titles.</p> </div> 						<hr class="Divider" align="center" /> 									<p id="CommentTitle">923 Comments To "Blue Hat Technique #19 - Keyword Spinning"</p>				 						 		<p class="CommentDate"><b>#1 Comment</b> By <u>Mark</u> On May 19, 2008 @ 1:48 am</p> 		<div class="CommentContent"><p>Hey Eli<br /> Thought you had disappeared off the face of the earth!!

I can attest that this method works great for long tailed titles.</p> <p>If your page title is very short (2-3 words like mentioned in the post) try running it through a google suggest program and add &#8221; a&#8221;, &#8221; b&#8221;, and on down the alphabet to get more keywords that are being searched and automate page creation that way.</p> <p>For example, if your title is &#8220;beer mugs&#8221;, you can send google suggest &#8220;beer mugs b&#8221; which will return &#8220;beer mugs budweiser&#8221;, &#8220;beer mugs bud light&#8221;, etc.</p> <p>automation is key and this will only work if you auto-generate content (scrape feeds, serp results, etc).</p> <p>Woops, sorry Eli, not my blog &#8230; I&#8217;ll let you take the podium back. </p> </div> 								 		<p class="CommentDate"><b>#10 Comment</b> By <u>Collin LaHay</u> On May 19, 2008 @ 1:39 pm</p> 		<div class="CommentContent"><p>Creative new technique as always.  <img src='/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif' alt=':-)' class='wp-smiley' /> </p> </div> 								 		<p class="CommentDate"><b>#11 Comment</b> By <u>Eli</u> On May 19, 2008 @ 2:31 pm</p> 		<div class="CommentContent"><p>No I definitely agree.

Now, in your post you DO mention that people need to work on their CTR in the search engines as well which is a good point to make, however, you don&#8217;t talk about the best way to do that in that article or in this one: split test your meta descriptions.</p> <p>By that I mean: look at your Google Webmastertools data and now Bing Webmastertools data, jot down the impressions and CTR of your posts, and then start improving your meta descriptions in a way that motivates people to take action more than usual. Come back a month later, compare results, optimize again, etc.</p> <p>The page with the highest CTR in the SERPS will, at some point in time, rank #1 no matter how awesome the other pages other.

However, I like to go to the next level by making permanent pages with varying titles of course written differently to prevent duplicate content. This means my pages are permanently indexed for those terms.. For example I might have a SEO website with a hosting affiliate. Then you could also have a &#8220;review&#8221; page for that affiliate, an &#8220;general information&#8221; page about the affiliate and a &#8220;comparison&#8221; page still dedicated primarily to that affiliate.
